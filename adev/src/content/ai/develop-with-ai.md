# Using AI for Development
Generating code with large language models (LLMs) is a rapidly growing area of interest for developers. While LLMs are often capable of generating working code it can be a challenge to generate code for consistently evolving frameworks like Angular.

Advanced instructions and prompting are an emerging standard for supporting modern code generation with domain specific details. This section contains curated content and resources to support more accurate code generation for Angular and LLMs.

## Providing Context with `llms.txt`
`llms.txt` is a proposed standard for websites designed to help LLMs better understand and process their content. The Angular team has developed two versions of this file to help LLMs and tools that use LLMs for code generation to create better Angular code:

* <a href="/llms.txt" target="_blank">llms.txt</a> - an index file providing links to key files and resources. 
* <a href="/llms-full.txt" target="_blank">llms-full.txt</a> - a more robust compiled set of resources describing how Angular works and how to build Angular applications.
