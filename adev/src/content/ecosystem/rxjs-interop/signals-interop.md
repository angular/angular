# RxJS interop with Angular signals

IMPORTANT: The RxJS Interop package is available for [developer preview](reference/releases#developer-preview). It's ready for you to try, but it might change before it is stable.

The `@angular/rxjs-interop` package offers APIs that help you integrate RxJS and Angular signals.

## Create a signal from an RxJs Observable with `toSignal`

Use the `toSignal` function to create a signal which tracks the value of an Observable. It behaves similarly to the `async` pipe in templates, but is more flexible and can be used anywhere in an application.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AsyncPipe } from '@angular/common';
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { toSignal } from '@angular/core/rxjs-interop';

@Component({
  template: `{{ counter() }}`,
})
export class Ticker {
  counterObservable = interval(1000);

  // Get a `Signal` representing the `counterObservable`'s value.
  counter = toSignal(this.counterObservable, {initialValue: 0});
}
```

Like the `async` pipe, `toSignal` subscribes to the Observable immediately, which may trigger side effects. The subscription created by `toSignal` automatically unsubscribes from the given Observable when the component or service which calls `toSignal` is destroyed.

IMPORTANT: `toSignal` creates a subscription. You should avoid calling it repeatedly for the same Observable, and instead reuse the signal it returns.

### Injection context

`toSignal` by default needs to run in an [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context), such as during construction of a component or service. If an injection context is not available, you can manually specify the `Injector` to use instead.

### Initial values

Observables may not produce a value synchronously on subscription, but signals always require a current value. There are several ways to deal with this "initial" value of `toSignal` signals.

#### The `initialValue` option

As in the example above, you can specify an `initialValue` option with the value the signal should return before the Observable emits for the first time.

#### `undefined` initial values

If you don't provide an `initialValue`, the resulting signal will return `undefined` until the Observable emits. This is similar to the `async` pipe's behavior of returning `null`.

#### The `requireSync` option

Some Observables are guaranteed to emit synchronously, such as `BehaviorSubject`. In those cases, you can specify the `requireSync: true` option.

When `requiredSync` is `true`, `toSignal` enforces that the Observable emits synchronously on subscription. This guarantees that the signal always has a value, and no `undefined` type or initial value is required.

### `manualCleanup`

By default, `toSignal` automatically unsubscribes from the Observable when the component or service that creates it is destroyed.

To override this behavior, you can pass the `manualCleanup` option. You can use this setting for Observables that complete themselves naturally.

### Error and Completion

If an Observable used in `toSignal` produces an error, that error is thrown when the signal is read.

If an Observable used in `toSignal` completes, the signal continues to return the most recently emitted value before completion.

## Create an RxJS Observable from a signal with `toObservable`

Use the `toObservable` utility to create an `Observable` which tracks the value of a signal. The signal's value is monitored with an `effect` which emits the value to the Observable when it changes.

```ts
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { toObservable } from '@angular/core/rxjs-interop';

@Component(...)
export class SearchResults {
  query: Signal<string> = inject(QueryService).query;
  query$ = toObservable(this.query);

  results$ = this.query$.pipe(
    switchMap(query => this.http.get('/search?q=' + query ))
  );
}
```

As the `query` signal changes, the `query$` Observable emits the latest query and triggers a new HTTP request.

### Injection context

`toObservable` by default needs to run in an [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context), such as during construction of a component or service. If an injection context is not available, you can manually specify the `Injector` to use instead.

### Timing of `toObservable`

`toObservable` uses an effect to track the value of the signal in a `ReplaySubject`. On subscription, the first value (if available) may be emitted synchronously, and all subsequent values will be asynchronous.

Unlike Observables, signals never provide a synchronous notification of changes. Even if you update a signal's value multiple times, `toObservable` will only emit the value after the signal stabilizes.

```ts
const obs$ = toObservable(mySignal);
obs$.subscribe(value => console.log(value));

mySignal.set(1);
mySignal.set(2);
mySignal.set(3);
```

Here, only the last value (3) will be logged.
