Welcome! This _Essentials_ guide explains some of Angular's main concepts, helping you understand what it's like to use the framework. This guide focuses on just a few building blocks as a short introduction. If you're looking for deep, comprehensive documentation, you can navigate to specific _In-depth Guides_ from the [documentation landing page](overview).

If you prefer to immediately start writing some code, you can [skip straight to the hands-on tutorial](tutorials/learn-angular).
