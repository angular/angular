# Slow computations

On every change detection cycle, Angular synchronously:

* Evaluates all template expressions in all components, unless specified otherwise, based on that each component's detection strategy
* Executes the `ngDoCheck`, `ngAfterContentChecked`, `ngAfterViewChecked`, and `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hooks.
A single slow computation within a template or a lifecycle hook can slow down the entire change detection process because Angular runs the computations sequentially.

## Identifying slow computations

You can identify heavy computations with Angular DevToolsâ€™ profiler. In the performance timeline, click a bar to preview a particular change detection cycle. This displays a bar chart, which shows how long the framework spent in change detection for each component. When you click a component, you can preview how long Angular spent  evaluating its template and lifecycle hooks.

For example, in the preceding screenshot, the second recorded change detection cycle is selected. Angular spent over 573 ms on this cycle, with the most time spent in the `EmployeeListComponent`. In the details panel, you can see that Angular spent over 297 ms evaluating the template of the `EmployeeListComponent`.

## Optimizing slow computations

Here are several techniques to remove slow computations:

* **Optimizing the underlying algorithm**. This is the recommended approach. If you can speed up the algorithm that is causing the problem, you can speed up the entire change detection mechanism.
* **Caching using pure pipes**. You can move the heavy computation to a pure [pipe](guide/pipes). Angular reevaluates a pure pipe only if it detects that its inputs have changed, compared to the previous time Angular called it.
* **Using memoization**. [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) is a similar technique to pure pipes, with the difference that pure pipes preserve only the last result from the computation where memoization could store multiple results.
* **Avoid repaints/reflows in lifecycle hooks**. Certain [operations](https://web.dev/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing/) cause the browser to either synchronously recalculate the layout of the page or re-render it. Since reflows and repaints are generally slow, you want to avoid performing them in every change detection cycle.

Pure pipes and memoization have different trade-offs. Pure pipes are an Angular built-in concept compared to memoization, which is a general software engineering practice for caching function results. The memory overhead of memoization could be significant if you invoke the heavy computation frequently with different arguments.
