# Query child elements with signal queries

Now that you've learned [how to use signals with directives](/tutorials/signals/7-using-signals-with-directives), let's explore signal-based query APIs. These provide a reactive way to access and interact with child components. Unlike traditional ViewChild, signal queries automatically update and provide type-safe access to child components.

In this activity, you'll add viewChild queries to interact with child components programmatically.

<docs-step title="Add viewChild import">
First, add the `viewChild` import to access child components in `app.ts`.

```ts
import {Component, signal, computed, viewChild} from '@angular/core';
```

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Create viewChild queries">
Add viewChild queries to the App component to access child components.

```ts
// Query APIs to access child components
firstProduct = viewChild(ProductCard);
cartSummary = viewChild(CartSummary);
```

These queries create signals that reference child component instances.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Implement parent methods">
Use the viewChild queries to call methods on child components in `app.ts`:

```ts
showFirstProductDetails() {
  const product = this.firstProduct();
  if (product) {
    product.highlight();
  }
}

initiateCheckout() {
  const summary = this.cartSummary();
  if (summary) {
    summary.initiateCheckout();
  }
}
```

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Test the interactions">
The control buttons should now work:

- **"Show First Product Details"** - Calls `highlight()` on the ProductCard
- **"Initiate Checkout"** - Calls `initiateCheckout()` on the CartSummary

Click the buttons to see how viewChild queries enable parent components to control child behavior.
</docs-step>

Perfect! You've learned how to use signal-based query APIs for child component interaction:
