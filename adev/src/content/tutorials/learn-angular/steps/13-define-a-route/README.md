# Define a Route

Now that you've set up the app to use Angular Router, you need to define the routes.

In this activity, you'll learn how to add and configure routes with your app.

<docs-step title="Define a route in `app.routes.ts`">

In your app, there are two pages to display: (1) Home Page and (2) User Page.

To define a route, add a route object to the `routes` array in `app.routes.ts` that contains:

- The `path` of the route (which automatically starts at the root path (i.e., `/`))
- The `component` that you want the route to display

```ts
import {Routes} from '@angular/router';

import {HomeComponent} from './home/home.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent,
  },
];
```

The code above is an example of how `HomeComponent` can be added as a route. Now go ahead and implement this along with the `UserComponent` in the playground.

Use `'user'` for the path of `UserComponent`.

In addition to defining the routes correctly, Angular Router also enables you to set the page title whenever users are navigating by adding the `title` property to each route.

In `app.routes.ts`, add the `title` property to the default route (`path: ''`) and the `user` route. Here's an example:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[8]">
import {Routes} from '@angular/router';

import {HomeComponent} from './home/home.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    title: 'App Home Page',
    component: HomeComponent,
  },
];
</docs-code>

</docs-step>

In the activity, you've learned how to define and configure routes in your Angular app. Nice work. ðŸ™Œ

The journey to fully enabling routing in your app is almost complete, keep going.
