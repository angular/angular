# Component input properties 

Sometimes app development requires you to send data into a component. This data can be used to customize a component or perhaps send information from a parent component to a child component.

Angular uses a concept called `input`. This is similar to `props` in other frameworks. To create an `input` property, use the `input()` function.

Note: Learn more about [accepting data with input properties in the inputs guide](/guide/components/inputs).

In this activity, you'll learn how to use the `input()` function to send information to components.

<hr>

To create an `input` property, add the `input()` function to initialize a property of a component class:

<docs-code header="user.ts" language="ts">
class User {
  occupation = input<string>();
}
</docs-code>

When you are ready to pass in a value through an `input`, values can be set in templates using the attribute syntax. Here's an example:

<docs-code header="app.ts" language="angular-ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({
  ...
  template: `<app-user occupation="Angular Developer"></app-user>`
})
class App {}
</docs-code>

The `input` function returns an `InputSignal`. You can read the value by calling the signal. 

<docs-code header="user.ts" language="angular-ts">
@Component({
  ...
  template: `<p>The user's occupation is {{occupation()}}</p>`
})
</docs-code>

<docs-step title="Define an `input()` property">
Update the code in `user.ts` to define an `input` property on the `User` called `name` and specify the `string` type. For now, don't set an initial value and invoke `input()` without arguments. Be sure to update the template to invoke and interpolate the `name` property at the end of the sentence.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Pass a value to the `input` property">
Update the code in `app.ts` to send in the `name` property with a value of `"Simran"`.
<br>

When the code has been successfully updated, the app will display `The user's name is Simran`.
</docs-step>

While this is great, it is only one direction of the component communication. What if you want to send information and data to a parent component from a child component? Check out the next lesson to find out.

P.S. you are doing great - keep going ðŸŽ‰
