# Server and hybrid rendering

## What is hybrid rendering?

Hybrid rendering combines the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR), pre-rendering (also known as "static site generation" or SSG) and client-side rendering (CSR) to optimize your Angular application. It allows you to render different parts of your application using different strategies, giving you fine-grained control over how your app is delivered to users.

## Setting up hybrid rendering

You can create a **new** project with server-side rendering with the Angular CLI:

```shell
ng new --ssr
```

You can also add server-side rendering to an existing project with the `ng add` command:

```shell
ng add @angular/ssr
```

Note: By default, Angular prerenders your entire application and generates a server file. To disable this and create a fully static app, set `outputMode` to `static`. To enable SSR, update the server routes to use `RenderMode.Server`.
For more details, see [`Server routing`](#server-routing) and [`Generate a fully static application`](#generate-a-fully-static-application).

## Server routing

### Configuring server routes

You can create a server route config by declaring an array of [`ServerRoute`](api/ssr/ServerRoute 'API reference') objects. This configuration typically lives in a file named `app.routes.server.ts`.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: '', // This renders the "/" route on the client (CSR)
    renderMode: RenderMode.Client,
  },
  {
    path: 'about', // This page is static, so we prerender it (SSG)
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
  },
  {
    path: 'profile', // This page requires user-specific data, so we use SSR
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
  },
  {
    path: '**', // All other routes will be rendered on the server (SSR)
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
  },
];
```

You can add this config to your application with [`provideServerRendering`](api/ssr/provideServerRendering 'API reference') using the [`withRoutes`](api/ssr/withRoutes 'API reference') function:

```typescript
import { provideServerRendering, withRoutes } from '@angular/ssr';
import { serverRoutes } from './app.routes.server';

// app.config.server.ts
const serverConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideServerRendering(withRoutes(serverRoutes)),
    // ... other providers ...
  ]
};
```

When using the [App shell pattern](ecosystem/service-workers/app-shell), you must specify the component to be used as the app shell for client-side rendered routes. To do this, use the [`withAppShell`](api/ssr/withAppShell 'API reference') fetaure:

```typescript
import { provideServerRendering, withRoutes, withAppShell } from '@angular/ssr';
import { AppShellComponent } from './app-shell/app-shell.component';

const serverConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideServerRendering(
      withRoutes(serverRoutes),
      withAppShell(AppShellComponent),
    ),
    // ... other providers ...
  ]
};
```

### Rendering modes

The server routing configuration lets you specify how each route in your application should render by setting a [`RenderMode`](api/ssr/RenderMode 'API reference'):

| Rendering mode      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server (SSR)**    | Renders the application on the server for each request, sending a fully populated HTML page to the browser. |
| **Client (CSR)**    | Renders the application in the browser. This is the default Angular behavior.                               |
| **Prerender (SSG)** | Prerenders the application at build time, generating static HTML files for each route.                      |

#### Choosing a rendering mode

Each rendering mode has different benefits and drawbacks. You can choose rendering modes based on the specific needs of your application.

##### Client-side rendering

Client-side rendering has the simplest development model, as you can write code that assumes it always runs in a web browser. This lets you use a wide range of client-side libraries that also assume they run in a browser.

Client-side rendering generally has worse performance than other rendering modes, as it must download, parse, and execute your page's JavaScript before the user can see any rendered content. If your page fetches more data from the server as it renders, users also have to wait for those additional requests before they can view the complete content.

If your page is indexed by search crawlers, client-side rendering may negatively affect search engine optimization (SEO), as search crawlers have limits to how much JavaScript they execute when indexing a page.

When client-side rendering, the server does not need to do any work to render a page beyond serving static JavaScript assets. You may consider this factor if server cost is a concern.

Applications that support installable, offline experiences with [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) can rely on client-side rendering without needing to communicate with a server.

##### Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering offers faster page loads than client-side rendering. Instead of waiting for JavaScript to download and run, the server directly renders an HTML document upon receiving a request from the browser. The user experiences only the latency necessary for the server to fetch data and render the requested page. This mode also eliminates the need for additional network requests from the browser, as your code can fetch data during rendering on the server.

Server-side rendering generally has excellent search engine optimization (SEO), as search crawlers receive a fully rendered HTML document.

Server-side rendering requires you to author code that does not strictly depend on browser APIs and limits your selection of JavaScript libraries that assume they run in a browser.

When server-side rendering, your server runs Angular to produce an HTML response for every request which may increase server hosting costs.

##### Build-time prerendering

Prerendering offers faster page loads than both client-side rendering and server-side rendering. Because prerendering creates HTML documents at _build-time_, the server can directly respond to requests with the static HTML document without any additional work.

Prerendering requires that all information necessary to render a page is available at _build-time_. This means that prerendered pages cannot include any data to the specific user loading the page. Prerendering is primarily useful for pages that are the same for all users of your application.

Because prerendering occurs at build-time, it may add significant time to your production builds. Using [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') to produce a large number of HTML documents may affect the total file size of your deployments, and thus lead to slower deployments.

Prerendering generally has excellent search engine optimization (SEO), as search crawlers receive a fully rendered HTML document.

Prerendering requires you to author code that does not strictly depend on browser APIs and limits your selection of JavaScript libraries that assume they run in a browser.

Prerendering incurs extremely little overhead per server request, as your server responds with static HTML documents. Static files are also easily cached by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), browsers, and intermediate caching layers for even faster subsequent page loads. Fully static sites can also be deployed solely through a CDN or static file server, eliminating the need to maintain a custom server runtime for your application. This enhances scalability by offloading work from an application web server, making it particularly beneficial for high-traffic applications.

Note: When using Angular service worker, the first request is server-rendered, but all subsequent requests are handled by the service worker and rendered client-side.

### Setting headers and status codes

You can set custom headers and status codes for individual server routes using the `headers` and `status` properties in the `ServerRoute` configuration.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'profile',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
    headers: {
      'X-My-Custom-Header': 'some-value',
    },
    status: 201,
  },
  // ... other routes
];
```

### Redirects

Angular handles redirects specified by the [`redirectTo`](api/router/Route#redirectTo 'API reference') property in route configurations, differently on the server-side.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
Redirects are performed using standard HTTP redirects (e.g., 301, 302) within the server-side rendering process.

**Prerendering (SSG)**
Redirects are implemented as "soft redirects" using [`<meta http-equiv="refresh">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#refresh) tags in the prerendered HTML.

### Customizing build-time prerendering (SSG)

When using [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference'), you can specify several configuration options to customize the prerendering and serving process.

#### Parameterized routes

For each route with [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference'), you can specify a [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') function. This function lets you control which specific parameters produce separate prerendered documents.

The [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of objects. Each object is a key-value map of route parameter name to value. For example, if you define a route like `posts/:id`, `getPrerenderParams ` could return the array `[{id: 123}, {id: 456}]`, and thus render separate documents for `posts/123` and `posts/456`.

The body of [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') can use Angular's [`inject`](api/core/inject 'API reference') function to inject dependencies and perform any work to determine which routes to prerender. This typically includes making requests to fetch data to construct the array of parameter values.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'post/:id',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
    async getPrerenderParams() {
      const dataService = inject(PostService);
      const ids = await dataService.getIds(); // Assuming this returns ['1', '2', '3']

      return ids.map(id => ({ id })); // Transforms IDs into an array of objects for prerendering

      // This will prerender the paths: `/post/1`, `/post/2` and `/post/3`
    },
  },
];
```

Because [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') exclusively applies to [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference'), this function always runs at _build-time_. `getPrerenderParams` must not rely on any browser-specific or server-specific APIs for data.

IMPORTANT: When using [`inject`](api/core/inject 'API reference') inside `getPrerenderParams`, please remember that `inject` must be used synchronously. It cannot be invoked within asynchronous callbacks or following any `await` statements. For more information, refer to [`runInInjectionContext`](api/core/runInInjectionContext).

#### Fallback strategies

When using [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference') mode, you can specify a fallback strategy to handle requests for paths that haven't been prerendered.

The available fallback strategies are:

- **Server:** Falls back to server-side rendering. This is the **default** behavior if no `fallback` property is specified.
- **Client:** Falls back to client-side rendering.
- **None:** No fallback. Angular will not handle requests for paths that are not prerendered.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, PrerenderFallback, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'post/:id',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
    fallback: PrerenderFallback.Client, // Fallback to CSR if not prerendered
    async getPrerenderParams() {
      // This function returns an array of objects representing prerendered posts at the paths:
      // `/post/1`, `/post/2`, and `/post/3`.
      // The path `/post/4` will utilize the fallback behavior if it's requested.
      return [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }];
    },
  },
];
```

## Accessing Request and Response via DI

The `@angular/core` package provides several tokens for interacting with the server-side rendering environment. These tokens give you access to crucial information and objects within your Angular application during SSR.

- **[`REQUEST`](api/core/REQUEST 'API reference'):** Provides access to the current request object, which is of type [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) from the Web API. This allows you to access headers, cookies, and other request information.
- **[`RESPONSE_INIT`](api/core/RESPONSE_INIT 'API reference'):** Provides access to the response initialization options, which is of type [`ResponseInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#parameters) from the Web API. This allows you to set headers and the status code for the response dynamically. Use this token to set headers or status codes that need to be determined at runtime.
- **[`REQUEST_CONTEXT`](api/core/REQUEST_CONTEXT 'API reference'):** Provides access to additional context related to the current request. This context can be passed as the second parameter of the [`handle`](api/ssr/AngularAppEngine#handle 'API reference') function. Typically, this is used to provide additional request-related information that is not part of the standard Web API.

```angular-ts
import { inject, REQUEST } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `<h1>My Component</h1>`,
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor() {
    const request = inject(REQUEST);
    console.log(request?.url);
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT: The above tokens will be `null` in the following scenarios:
- During the build processes.
- When the application is rendered in the browser (CSR).
- When performing static site generation (SSG).
- During route extraction in development (at the time of the request).

## Configuring a server

### Node.js

The `@angular/ssr/node` extends `@angular/ssr` specifically for Node.js environments. It provides APIs that make it easier to implement server-side rendering within your Node.js application. For a complete list of functions and usage examples, refer to the [`@angular/ssr/node` API reference](api/ssr/node/AngularNodeAppEngine) API reference.

```typescript
// server.ts
import { AngularNodeAppEngine, createNodeRequestHandler, writeResponseToNodeResponse } from '@angular/ssr/node';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();

app.use('*', (req, res, next) => {
  angularApp
    .handle(req)
    .then(response => {
      if (response) {
        writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res);
      } else {
        next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
      }
    })
    .catch(next);
});

/**
 * The request handler used by the Angular CLI (dev-server and during build).
 */
export const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);
```

### Non-Node.js

The `@angular/ssr` provides essential APIs for server-side rendering your Angular application on platforms other than Node.js. It leverages the standard [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects from the Web API, enabling you to integrate Angular SSR into various server environments. For detailed information and examples, refer to the [`@angular/ssr` API reference](api/ssr/AngularAppEngine).

```typescript
// server.ts
import { AngularAppEngine, createRequestHandler } from '@angular/ssr';

const angularApp = new AngularAppEngine();

/**
 * This is a request handler used by the Angular CLI (dev-server and during build).
 */
export const reqHandler = createRequestHandler(async (req: Request) => {
  const res: Response|null = await angularApp.render(req);

  // ...
});
```

## Generate a fully static application

By default, Angular prerenders your entire application and generates a server file for handling requests. This allows your app to serve pre-rendered content to users. However, if you prefer a fully static site without a server, you can opt out of this behavior by setting the `outputMode` to `static` in your `angular.json` configuration file.

When `outputMode` is set to `static`, Angular generates pre-rendered HTML files for each route at build time, but it does not generate a server file or require a Node.js server to serve the app. This is useful for deploying to static hosting providers where a backend server is not needed.

To configure this, update your `angular.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-app": {
      "architect": {
        "prerender": {
          "options": {
            "outputMode": "static"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Caching data when using HttpClient

[`HttpClient`](api/common/http/HttpClient) cached outgoing network requests when running on the server. This information is serialized and transferred to the browser as part of the initial HTML sent from the server. In the browser, `HttpClient` checks whether it has data in the cache and if so, reuses it instead of making a new HTTP request during initial application rendering. `HttpClient` stops using the cache once an application becomes [stable](api/core/ApplicationRef#isStable) while running in a browser.

By default, `HttpClient` caches all `HEAD` and `GET` requests which don't contain `Authorization` or `Proxy-Authorization` headers. You can override those settings by using [`withHttpTransferCacheOptions`](api/platform-browser/withHttpTransferCacheOptions) when providing hydration.

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideClientHydration(withHttpTransferCacheOptions({
      includePostRequests: true
    }))
  ]
});
```

## Authoring server-compatible components

Some common browser APIs and capabilities might not be available on the server. Applications cannot make use of browser-specific global objects like `window`, `document`, `navigator`, or `location` as well as certain properties of `HTMLElement`.

In general, code which relies on browser-specific symbols should only be executed in the browser, not on the server. This can be enforced through the [`afterRender`](api/core/afterRender) and [`afterNextRender`](api/core/afterNextRender) lifecycle hooks. These are only executed on the browser and skipped on the server.

```angular-ts
import { Component, ViewChild, afterNextRender } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-cmp',
  template: `<span #content>{{ ... }}</span>`,
})
export class MyComponent {
  @ViewChild('content') contentRef: ElementRef;

  constructor() {
    afterNextRender(() => {
      // Safe to check `scrollHeight` because this will only run in the browser, not the server.
      console.log('content height: ' + this.contentRef.nativeElement.scrollHeight);
    });
  }
}
```
