# Creating an injectable service

Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an application needs.
A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose.
A component is one type of class that can use DI.

Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability.
By separating a component's view-related features from other kinds of processing, you can make your component classes lean and efficient.

Ideally, a component's job is to enable the user experience and nothing more.
A component should present properties and methods for data binding, to mediate between the view (rendered by the template) and the application logic (which often includes some notion of a model).

A component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console.
By defining such processing tasks in an injectable service class, you make those tasks available to any component.
You can also make your application more adaptable by configuring different providers of the same kind of service, as appropriate in different circumstances.

Angular does not enforce these principles.
Angular helps you follow these principles by making it easy to factor your application logic into services and make those services available to components through DI.

## Service examples

Here's an example of a service class that logs to the browser console:

<docs-code header="src/app/logger.service.ts (class)" language="typescript">
export class Logger {
  log(msg: unknown) { console.log(msg); }
  error(msg: unknown) { console.error(msg); }
  warn(msg: unknown) { console.warn(msg); }
}
</docs-code>

Services can depend on other services.
For example, here's a `HeroService` that depends on the `Logger` service, and also uses `BackendService` to get heroes.
That service in turn might depend on the `HttpClient` service to fetch heroes asynchronously from a server:

<docs-code header="src/app/hero.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[7,8,12,13]">
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class HeroService {
  private heroes: Hero[] = [];

  private backend = inject(BackendService);
  private logger = inject(Logger);

  async getHeroes() {
    // Fetch
    this.heroes = await this.backend.getAll(Hero);
    // Log
    this.logger.log(`Fetched ${this.heroes.length} heroes.`);
    return this.heroes;
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Creating an injectable service

The Angular CLI provides a command to create a new service. In the following example, you add a new service to an existing application.

To generate a new `HeroService` class in the `src/app/heroes` folder, follow these steps:

1. Run this [Angular CLI](/tools/cli) command:

<docs-code language="sh">
ng generate service heroes/hero
</docs-code>

This command creates the following default `HeroService`:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts (CLI-generated)" language="typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {}
</docs-code>

The `@Injectable()` decorator specifies that Angular can use this class in the DI system.
The metadata, `providedIn: 'root'`, means that the `HeroService` is provided throughout the application.

Add a `getHeroes()` method that returns the heroes from `mock.heroes.ts` to get the hero mock data:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts" language="typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes';

@Injectable({
  // declares that this service should be created
  // by the root application injector.
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {
  getHeroes() {
    return HEROES;
  }
}
</docs-code>

For clarity and maintainability, it is recommended that you define components and services in separate files.

## Injecting services

To inject a service as a dependency into a component, you can declare a class field representing the dependency and use Angular's `inject` function to initialize it.

The following example specifies the `HeroService` in the `HeroListComponent`.
The type of `heroService` is `HeroService`.
Angular recognizes the `HeroService` type as a dependency, since that class was previously annotated with the `@Injectable` decorator:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts" language="typescript">
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class HeroListComponent {
  private heroService = inject(HeroService);
}
</docs-code>

It is also possible to inject a service into a component using the component's constructor:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts (constructor signature)" language="typescript">
  constructor(private heroService: HeroService)
</docs-code>

The `inject` method can be used in both classes and functions, while the constructor method can naturally only be used in a class constructor. However, in either case a dependency may only be injected in a valid [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context), usually in the construction or initialization of a component.

## Injecting services in other services

When a service depends on another service, follow the same pattern as injecting into a component.
In the following example, `HeroService` depends on a `Logger` service to report its activities:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[3,9,12]">
import { inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes';
import { Logger } from '../logger.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {
  private logger = inject(Logger);

  getHeroes() {
    this.logger.log('Getting heroes.');
    return HEROES;
  }
}
</docs-code>

In this example, the `getHeroes()` method uses the `Logger` service by logging a message when fetching heroes.
