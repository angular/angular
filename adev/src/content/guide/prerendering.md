# Prerendering (SSG)

Prerendering, commonly referred to as Static Site Generation (SSG), represents the method by which pages are rendered to static HTML files during the build process.

Prerendering maintains the same performance benefits of [server-side rendering (SSR)](guide/ssr#why-use-server-side-rendering) but achieves a reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB), ultimately enhancing user experience. The key distinction lies in its approach that pages are served as static content, and there is no request-based rendering.

When the data necessary for server-side rendering remains consistent across all users, the strategy of prerendering emerges as a valuable alternative. Rather than dynamically rendering pages for each user request, prerendering takes a proactive approach by rendering them in advance.

## How to prerender a page

To prerender a static page, add SSR capabilities to your application with the following Angular CLI command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng add @angular/ssr

</docs-code>

<div class="docs-alert docs-alert-helpful">

To create an application with prerendering capabilities from the beginning use the [`ng new --ssr`](tools/cli/setup-local) command.

</div>

Once SSR is added, you can generate the static pages by running the build command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng build

</docs-code>

### Build options for prerender

The application builder `prerender` option can be either a Boolean or an Object for more fine-tuned configuration.
When the option is `false`, no prerendering is done. When it is `true`, all options use the default value. When it is an Object, each option can be individually configured.

| Options          | Details                                                                                                                                                                   | Default Value |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------ |
| `discoverRoutes` | Whether the builder should process the Angular Router configuration to find all unparameterized routes and prerender them.                                                | `true`        |
| `routesFile`     | The path to a file that contains a list of all routes to prerender, separated by newlines. This option is useful if you want to prerender routes with parameterized URLs. |               |

<docs-code language="json">

{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
          "options": {
            "prerender": {
              "discoverRoutes": false
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

</docs-code>

### Prerendering parameterized routes

You can prerender parameterized routes using the `routesFile` option. An example of a parameterized route is `product/:id`, where `id` is dynamically provided. To specify these routes, they should be listed in a text file, with each route on a separate line.

For an app with a large number of parameterized routes, consider generating this file using a script before running `ng build`.

<docs-code header="routes.txt" language="text">

/products/1
/products/555

</docs-code>

With routes specified in the `routes.txt` file, use the `routesFile` option to configure the builder to prerender the product routes.

<docs-code language="json">

{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
          "options": {
            "prerender": {
              "routesFile": "routes.txt"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

</docs-code>

This configures `ng build` to prerender `/products/1` and `/products/555` at build time.
