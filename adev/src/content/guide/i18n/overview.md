# Angular Internationalization (i18n)

*Internationalization*, sometimes referenced as i18n, is the process of designing and preparing your project for use in different locales around the world.
*Localization* is the process of building versions of your project for different locales.
The localization process includes the following actions.

* Extract text for translation into different languages
* Format data for a specific locale

A *locale* identifies a region in which people speak a particular language or language variant.
Possible regions include countries and geographical regions.
A locale determines the formatting and parsing of the following details.

* Measurement units including date and time, numbers, and currencies
* Translated names including time zones, languages, and countries
