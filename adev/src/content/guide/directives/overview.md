Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.
</docs-decorative-header>

Use Angular's built-in directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.

The different types of Angular directives are as follows:

| Directive Types                                          | Details                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Components](guide/components)                           | Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.   |
| [Attribute directives](#built-in-attribute-directives)   | Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. |

This guide covers built-in [attribute directives](#built-in-attribute-directives).

## Built-in attribute directives

Attribute directives listen to and modify the behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.

The most common attribute directives are as follows:

| Common directives                                             | Details                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| [`NgClass`](#adding-and-removing-classes-with-ngclass)        | Adds and removes a set of CSS classes.             |
| [`NgStyle`](#setting-inline-styles-with-ngstyle)              | Adds and removes a set of HTML styles.             |
| [`NgModel`](#displaying-and-updating-properties-with-ngmodel) | Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element. |

HELPFUL: Built-in directives use only public APIs. They do not have special access to any private APIs that other directives can't access.

## Adding and removing classes with `NgClass`

Add or remove multiple CSS classes simultaneously with `ngClass`.

HELPFUL: To add or remove a _single_ class, use [class binding](guide/templates/class-binding) rather than `NgClass`.

### Import `NgClass` in the component

To use `NgClass`, add it to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgClass import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-class"/>

### Using `NgClass` with an expression

On the element you'd like to style, add `[ngClass]` and set it equal to an expression.
In this case, `isSpecial` is a boolean set to `true` in `app.component.ts`.
Because `isSpecial` is true, `ngClass` applies the class of `special` to the `<div>`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="special-div"/>

### Using `NgClass` with a method

1. To use `NgClass` with a method, add the method to the component class.
   In the following example, `setCurrentClasses()` sets the property `currentClasses` with an object that adds or removes three classes based on the `true` or `false` state of three other component properties.

   Each key of the object is a CSS class name.
   If a key is `true`, `ngClass` adds the class.
   If a key is `false`, `ngClass` removes the class.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="setClasses"/>

1. In the template, add the `ngClass` property binding to `currentClasses` to set the element's classes:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgClass-1"/>

For this use case, Angular applies the classes on initialization and in case of changes caused by reassigning the `currentClasses` object.
The full example calls `setCurrentClasses()` initially with `ngOnInit()` when the user clicks on the `Refresh currentClasses` button.
These steps are not necessary to implement `ngClass`.

## Setting inline styles with `NgStyle`

HELPFUL: To add or remove a _single_ style, use [style bindings](guide/templates/binding#css-class-and-style-property-bindings) rather than `NgStyle`.

### Import `NgStyle` in the component

To use `NgStyle`, add it to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgStyle import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-style"/>

Use `NgStyle` to set multiple inline styles simultaneously, based on the state of the component.

1. To use `NgStyle`, add a method to the component class.

   In the following example, `setCurrentStyles()` sets the property `currentStyles` with an object that defines three styles, based on the state of three other component properties.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="setStyles"/>

1. To set the element's styles, add an `ngStyle` property binding to `currentStyles`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgStyle-2"/>

For this use case, Angular applies the styles upon initialization and in case of changes.
To do this, the full example calls `setCurrentStyles()` initially with `ngOnInit()` and when the dependent properties change through a button click.
However, these steps are not necessary to implement `ngStyle` on its own.

## Displaying and updating properties with `ngModel`

Use the `NgModel` directive to display a data property and update that property when the user makes changes.

1. Import `FormsModule` and add it to the AppComponent's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (FormsModule import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-forms-module" />

1. Add an `[(ngModel)]` binding on an HTML `<form>` element and set it equal to the property, here `name`.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (NgModel example)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgModel-1"/>

   This `[(ngModel)]` syntax can only set a data-bound property.

To customize your configuration, write the expanded form, which separates the property and event binding.
Use [property binding](guide/templates/property-binding) to set the property and [event binding](guide/templates/event-listeners) to respond to changes.
The following example changes the `<input>` value to uppercase:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="uppercase"/>

Here are all variations in action, including the uppercase version:

### `NgModel` and value accessors

The `NgModel` directive works for an element supported by a [ControlValueAccessor](api/forms/ControlValueAccessor).
Angular provides _value accessors_ for all of the basic HTML form elements.
For more information, see [Forms](guide/forms).

To apply `[(ngModel)]` to a non-form built-in element or a third-party custom component, you have to write a value accessor.
For more information, see the API documentation on [DefaultValueAccessor](api/forms/DefaultValueAccessor).

HELPFUL: When you write an Angular component, you don't need a value accessor or `NgModel` if you name the value and event properties according to Angular's [two-way binding syntax](guide/templates/two-way-binding#how-two-way-binding-works).

## Hosting a directive without a DOM element

The Angular `<ng-container>` is a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn't put it in the DOM.

Use `<ng-container>` when there's no single element to host the directive.

Here's a conditional paragraph using `<ng-container>`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (ngif-ngcontainer)" path="adev/src/content/examples/structural-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="ngif-ngcontainer"/>

<img alt="ngcontainer paragraph with proper style" src="assets/images/guide/structural-directives/good-paragraph.png">

1. Import the `ngModel` directive from `FormsModule`.

1. Add `FormsModule` to the imports section of the relevant Angular module.

1. To conditionally exclude an `<option>`, wrap the `<option>` in an `<ng-container>`.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (select-ngcontainer)" path="adev/src/content/examples/structural-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="select-ngcontainer"/>
