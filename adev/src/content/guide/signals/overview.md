Angular Signals is a system that granularly tracks how and where your state is used throughout an application, allowing the framework to optimize rendering updates.

TIP: Check out Angular's [Essentials](essentials/signals) before diving into this comprehensive guide.

## What are signals?

A **signal** is a wrapper around a value that notifies interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from primitives to complex data structures.

You read a signal's value by calling its getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.

Signals may be either _writable_ or _read-only_.

### Writable signals

Writable signals provide an API for updating their values directly. You create writable signals by calling the `signal` function with the signal's initial value:

```ts
const count = signal(0);

// Signals are getter functions - calling them reads their value.
console.log('The count is: ' + count());
```

To change the value of a writable signal, either `.set()` it directly:

```ts
count.set(3);
```

or use the `.update()` operation to compute a new value from the previous one:

```ts
// Increment the count by 1.
count.update(value => value + 1);
```

Writable signals have the type `WritableSignal`.

### Computed signals

**Computed signal** are read-only signals that derive their value from other signals. You define computed signals using the `computed` function and specifying a derivation:

```typescript
const count: WritableSignal<number> = signal(0);
const doubleCount: Signal<number> = computed(() => count() * 2);
```

The `doubleCount` signal depends on the `count` signal. Whenever `count` updates, Angular knows that `doubleCount` needs to update as well.

#### Computed signals are both lazily evaluated and memoized

`doubleCount`'s derivation function does not run to calculate its value until the first time you read `doubleCount`. The calculated value is then cached, and if you read `doubleCount` again, it will return the cached value without recalculating.

If you then change `count`, Angular knows that `doubleCount`'s cached value is no longer valid, and the next time you read `doubleCount` its new value will be calculated.

As a result, you can safely perform computationally expensive derivations in computed signals, such as filtering arrays.

#### Computed signals are not writable signals

You cannot directly assign values to a computed signal. That is,

```ts
doubleCount.set(3);
```

produces a compilation error, because `doubleCount` is not a `WritableSignal`.

#### Computed signal dependencies are dynamic

Only the signals actually read during the derivation are tracked. For example, in this `computed` the `count` signal is only read if the `showCount` signal is true:

```ts
const showCount = signal(false);
const count = signal(0);
const conditionalCount = computed(() => {
  if (showCount()) {
    return `The count is ${count()}.`;
  } else {
    return 'Nothing to see here!';
  }
});
```

When you read `conditionalCount`, if `showCount` is `false` the "Nothing to see here!" message is returned _without_ reading the `count` signal. This means that if you later update `count` it will _not_ result in a recomputation of `conditionalCount`.

If you set `showCount` to `true` and then read `conditionalCount` again, the derivation will re-execute and take the branch where `showCount` is `true`, returning the message which shows the value of `count`. Changing `count` will then invalidate `conditionalCount`'s cached value.

Note that dependencies can be removed during a derivation as well as added. If you later set `showCount` back to `false`, then `count` will no longer be considered a dependency of `conditionalCount`.

## Advanced derivations

While `computed` handles simple readonly derivations, you might find youself needing a writable state that is dependant on other signals.
For more information see the [Dependent state with linkedSignal](/guide/signals/linked-signal) guide.

All signal APIs are synchronousâ€” `signal`, `computed`, `input`, etc. However, applications often need to deal with data that is available asynchronously. A `Resource` gives you a way to incorporate async data into your application's signal-based code and still allow you to access its data synchronously. For more information see the [Async reactivity with resources](/guide/signals/resource) guide.

## Executing side effects on non-reactive APIs

Synchronous or asynchronous derivations are recommended when we want to react to state changes. However this doesn't cover all the usecase and you'll sometime find yourself in a situation where you need to react on signal changes on non-reactive apis. Use `effect` or `afterRenderEffect` for those specific usecases. For more information see [Side effects for non-reactives APIs](/guide/effect) guide.

## Reading signals in `OnPush` components

When you read a signal within an `OnPush` component's template, Angular tracks the signal as a dependency of that component. When the value of that signal changes, Angular automatically [marks](api/core/ChangeDetectorRef#markforcheck) the component to ensure it gets updated the next time change detection runs. Refer to the [Skipping component subtrees](best-practices/skipping-subtrees) guide for more information about `OnPush` components.

## Advanced topics

### Signal equality functions

When creating a signal, you can optionally provide an equality function, which will be used to check whether the new value is actually different than the previous one.

```ts
import _ from 'lodash';

const data = signal(['test'], {equal: _.isEqual});

// Even though this is a different array instance, the deep equality
// function will consider the values to be equal, and the signal won't
// trigger any updates.
data.set(['test']);
```

Equality functions can be provided to both writable and computed signals.

HELPFUL: By default, signals use referential equality ([`Object.is()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison).

### Reading without tracking dependencies

Rarely, you may want to execute code which may read signals within a reactive function such as `computed` or `effect` _without_ creating a dependency.

For example, suppose that when `currentUser` changes, the value of a `counter` should be logged. You could create an `effect` which reads both signals:

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`User set to ${currentUser()} and the counter is ${counter()}`);
});
```

This example will log a message when _either_ `currentUser` or `counter` changes. However, if the effect should only run when `currentUser` changes, then the read of `counter` is only incidental and changes to `counter` shouldn't log a new message.

You can prevent a signal read from being tracked by calling its getter with `untracked`:

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`User set to ${currentUser()} and the counter is ${untracked(counter)}`);
});
```

`untracked` is also useful when an effect needs to invoke some external code which shouldn't be treated as a dependency:

```ts
effect(() => {
  const user = currentUser();
  untracked(() => {
    // If the `loggingService` reads signals, they won't be counted as
    // dependencies of this effect.
    this.loggingService.log(`User set to ${user}`);
  });
});
```

## Using signals with RxJS
