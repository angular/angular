Tip: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Every component must have:

* A TypeScript class with _behaviors_ such as handling user input and fetching data from a server
* An HTML template that controls what renders into the DOM
* A [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors) that defines how the component is used in HTML

You provide Angular-specific information for a component by adding a `@Component` [decorator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) on top of the TypeScript class:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[1, 2, 3, 4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

For full details on writing Angular templates, including data binding, event handling, and control flow, see the [Templates guide](guide/templates).

The object passed to the `@Component` decorator is called the component's **metadata**. This includes the `selector`, `template`, and other properties described throughout this guide.

Components can optionally include a list of CSS styles that apply to that component's DOM:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
  styles: `img { border-radius: 50%; }`,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

By default, a component's styles only affect elements defined in that component's template. See [Styling Components](guide/components/styling) for details on Angular's approach to styling.

You can alternatively choose to write your template and styles in separate files:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[3, 4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  templateUrl: 'profile-photo.html',
  styleUrl: 'profile-photo.css',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

This can help separate the concerns of _presentation_ from _behavior_ in your project. You can choose one approach for your entire project, or you decide which to use for each component.

Both `templateUrl` and `styleUrl` are relative to the directory in which the component resides.

## Using components

### Imports in the `@Component` decorator

To use a component, [directive](guide/directives), or [pipe](guide/templates/pipes), you must add
it to the `imports` array in the `@Component` decorator:

```angular-ts
import {ProfilePhoto} from './profile-photo';

@Component({
  // Import the `ProfilePhoto` component in
  // order to use it in this component's template.
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  /* ... */
})
export class UserProfile { }
```

By default, Angular components are *standalone*, meaning that you can directly add them to the `imports` array of other components. Components created with an earlier version of Angular may instead specify `standalone: false` in their `@Component` decorator. For these components, you instead import the `NgModule` in which the component is defined. See the full [`NgModule` guide](guide/ngmodules) for details.

Important: In Angular versions before 19.0.0, the `standalone` option defaults to `false`.

### Showing components in a template

Every component defines a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors):

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  ...
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

See [Component Selectors](guide/components/selectors) for details about which types of selectors Angular supports and guidance on choosing a selector.

You show a component by creating a matching HTML element in the template of _other_ components:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[8]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }

@Component({
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  template: `<profile-photo />`
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

Angular creates an instance of the component for every matching HTML element it encounters. The DOM element that matches a component's selector is referred to as that component's **host element**. The contents of a component's template are rendered inside its host element.

The DOM rendered by a component, corresponding to that component's template, is called that
component's **view**.

In composing components in this way, **you can think of your Angular application as a tree of components**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[AccountSettings]-->B
    A-->C
    B[UserProfile]-->D
    B-->E
    C[PaymentInfo]
    D[ProfilePic]
    E[UserBio]
```


This tree structure is important to understanding several other Angular concepts, including [dependency injection](guide/di) and [child queries](guide/components/queries).
