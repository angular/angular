# Migration to signal inputs

Angular introduced an improved API for inputs that is considered
production ready as of v19.
Read more about signal inputs and their benefits in the [dedicated guide](guide/signals/inputs).

To support existing teams that would like to use signal inputs, the Angular team
provides an automated migration that converts `@Input` fields to the new `input()` API.

Run the schematic using the following command:

```bash
ng generate @angular/core:signal-input-migration
```

Alternatively, the migration is available as a [code refactor action](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-refactoring#_refactoring) in VSCode.
Install the latest version of the VSCode extension and click on an `@Input` field.
See more details in the section [below](#vscode-extension).

## What does the migration change?

1. `@Input()` class members are updated to their signal `input()` equivalent.
2. References to migrated inputs are updated to call the signal.
   - This includes references in templates, host bindings or TypeScript code.

**Before**

```typescript
import {Component, Input} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  template: `Name: {{name ?? ''}}`
})
export class MyComponent {
  @Input() name: string|undefined = undefined;

  someMethod(): number {
    if (this.name) {
      return this.name.length;
    }
    return -1;
  }
}
```

**After**

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[[4],[7], [10,12]]">
import {Component, input} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
template: `Name: {{name() ?? ''}}`
})
export class MyComponent {
readonly name = input<string>();

someMethod(): number {
const name = this.name();
if (name) {
return name.length;
}
return -1;
}
}
</docs-code>

## Configuration options

The migration supports a few options for fine tuning the migration to your specific needs.

### `--path`

By default, the migration will update your whole Angular CLI workspace.
You can limit the migration to a specific sub-directory using this option.

### `--best-effort-mode`

By default, the migration skips inputs that cannot be safely migrated.
The migration tries to refactor code as safely as possible.

When the `--best-effort-mode` flag is enabled, the migration eagerly
tries to migrate as much as possible, even if it could break your build.

### `--insert-todos`

When enabled, the migration will add TODOs to inputs that couldn't be migrated.
The TODOs will include reasoning on why inputs were skipped. E.g.

```ts
// TODO: Skipped for migration because:
//  Your application code writes to the input. This prevents migration.
@Input() myInput = false;
```

### `--analysis-dir`

In large projects you may use this option to reduce the amount of files being analyzed.
By default, the migration analyzes the whole workspace, regardless of the `--path` option, in
order to update all references affected by an `@Input()` migration.

With this option, you can limit analysis to a sub-folder. Note that this means that any
references outside this directory are silently skipped, potentially breaking your build.

## VSCode extension

The migration is available as a [code refactor action](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-refactoring#_refactoring) in VSCode.

To make use of the migration via VSCode, install the latest version of the VSCode extension and either click:

- on a `@Input` field.
- or, on a directive/component

Then, wait for the yellow lightbulb VSCode refactoring button to appear.
Via this button you can then select the signal input migration.
