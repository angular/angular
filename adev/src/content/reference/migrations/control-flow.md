# Migration to Control Flow syntax

[Control flow syntax](guide/templates/control-flow) is available from Angular v17. The new syntax is baked into the template, so you don't need to import `CommonModule` anymore.

This schematic migrates all existing code in your application to use new Control Flow Syntax.

Run the schematic using the following command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng generate @angular/core:control-flow

</docs-code>
