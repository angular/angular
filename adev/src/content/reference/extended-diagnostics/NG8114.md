# Unparenthesized Nullish Coalescing

This diagnostic detects cases where the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is mixed with the logical
or (`||`) or logical and (`&&`) operators without parentheses to disambiguate precedence.

<docs-code language="typescript">

import {Component, signal, Signal} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  template: `
    <button [disabled]="hasPermission() && task()?.disabled ?? true">
      Run
    </button>
  `,
})
class MyComponent {
  hasPermission = input(false);
  task = input<Task|undefined>(undefined);
}

</docs-code>

## What's wrong with that?

Without disambiguating parentheses, its difficult to understand whether the `??` or `||`/`&&` is
evaluated first. This is considered an error in TypeScript and JavaScript, but has historically been
allowed in Angular templates.

## What should I do instead?

Always use parentheses to disambiguate in theses situations. If you're unsure what the original
intent of the code was but want to keep the behavior the same, place the parentheses around the `??`
operator.

import {Component, signal, Signal} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  template: `
    <button [disabled]="hasPermission() && (task()?.disabled ?? true)">
      Run
    </button>
  `,
})
class MyComponent {
  hasPermission = input(false);
  task = input<Task|undefined>(undefined);
}
