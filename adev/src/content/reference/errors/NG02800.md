# JSONP support in HttpClient configuration

Angular produces this error when you attempt a `JSONP` request without providing the necessary support for it in the `HttpClient` configuration.
To enable `JSONP` support, you can do one of the following:

- add the `withJsonpSupport()` as an argument during the `provideHttpClient` function call (e.g. `provideHttpClient(withJsonpSupport())`) when `bootstrapApplication` is useddocs
- import the `HttpClientJsonpModule` in your root AppModule, when NgModule-based bootstrap is used.

## Debugging the error
Make sure that the JSONP support is added into your application either by calling the `withJsonpSupport` function (when `provideHttpClient` is used) or importing the `HttpClientJsonpModule` module as described above.
