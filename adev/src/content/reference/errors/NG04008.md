# Invalid or undefined route configuration or navigation path

This runtime error occurs when Angular's router is unable to resolve a valid route during navigation. Common causes include misconfigured or undefined route configurations, invalid navigation paths, or issues with lazy-loaded modules.

## Debugging the error

You can use `Router.events` to capture navigation error logs:

```typescript

this.router.events.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event instanceof NavigationError) {
    console.error("Navigation Error:", event.error);
  }
});

```

## Fixing the error

1. Check that all routes are correctly configured in all routing modules. Ensure no paths resolve to `undefined`.

2. If you are using lazy-loading, make sure that `loadChildren` uses proper module references.

3. If you use dynamic navigation in your application, check that `Router.navigate` or `Router.navigateByUrl` are not invoked with an empty string, incorrect or undefined parameters as an argument.

```typescript

this.router.navigate([undefined]); // this is invalid

```

4. Make sure your wildcard routes have proper fallback routes.

```typescript

{ path: '**', redirectTo: '' } // handle unmatched paths correctly

```
