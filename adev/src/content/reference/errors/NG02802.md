# Headers not transferred by HttpTransferCache

Angular produces this warning when code attempts to access an HTTP header that was not transferred from the server to the client by the `HttpTransferCache`.

By default, `HttpTransferCache` does not transfer any headers to avoid potential security issues or unnecessary data transfer. When a header is accessed on the client that wasn't included, Angular logs this warning to help you identify missing headers.

## Fixing the error

To include specific headers in the transfer cache, use the `includeHeaders` option.

### At the request level

Add the `transferCache` parameter to your HTTP request:

```typescript
this.http.get('/api/data', {
  transferCache: {
    includeHeaders: ['cache-control', 'etag']
  }
});
```

### At the application level

Configure `includeHeaders` when providing the transfer cache:

```typescript
provideClientHydration(
  withHttpTransferCache({
    includeHeaders: ['cache-control', 'etag']
  })
);
```

Only include headers that are necessary for your application logic. Be cautious with sensitive headers.

## Debugging the error

The warning message includes the header name and the request URL. Check your code for where this header is being accessed and determine if it needs to be included in the transfer cache.

If the header is not needed on the client, consider refactoring your code to avoid accessing it.
