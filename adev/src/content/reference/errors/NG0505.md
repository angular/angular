# No hydration info in server response

This error occurs when hydration is enabled on the client, but the server response
doesn't contain special serialized information about the application that hydration
logic relies on.

This can happen when the `provideClientHydration()` function is included in the client
part of the application configuration, but is missing in the server part of the configuration.

In applications with the default project structure (generated by the `ng new`),
the `provideClientHydration()` call is added either into the `providers` array of
the main `AppModule` (which is imported into the server module) or into a set of
providers that are included into both client and server configurations.

If you have a custom setup where client and server configuration are independent
and do not share common set of providers, make sure that the `provideClientHydration()`
is also included into the set of providers used to bootstrap an application on the server.

More information about hydration can be found in [this guide](guide/hydration).

## Debugging the error

Verify that the `provideClientHydration()` call is included into a set of providers
that is used to bootstrap an application on the server.
