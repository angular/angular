# Invalid Attribute

<docs-video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfLkB3RsSJM"/>

An attribute or property cannot be resolved during compilation.

This error arises when attempting to bind to a property that does not exist.
Any property binding must correspond to either:

* A native property on the HTML element, or
* An `@Input()` property of a component or directive applied to the element.

The runtime error for this is `NG0304: '${tagName}' is not a known element: â€¦'`.

## Debugging the error

Look at documentation for the specific [binding syntax](guide/templates) used. This is usually a typo or incorrect import.
There may also be a missing direction with property selector 'name' or missing input.
