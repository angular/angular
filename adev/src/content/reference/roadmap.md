<docs-decorative-header title="Angular Roadmap" imgSrc="adev/src/assets/images/roadmap.svg"> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
Learn how the Angular team is building momentum on the web.
</docs-decorative-header>

As an open source project, Angular’s daily commits, PRs and momentum is all trackable on GitHub. To increase transparency into how this daily work connects to the framework’s future, our roadmap brings together the team’s current and future planned vision.

The following projects are not associated with a particular Angular version. We will release them on completion, and they will be part of a specific version based on our release schedule, following semantic versioning. For example, we release features in the next minor after completion or the next major if they include breaking changes.

Currently, Angular has two goals for the framework:

1. Improve the [Angular developer experience](#improving-the-angular-developer-experience) and
2. Improve the [framework’s performance](#fast-by-default).

Continue reading to learn how we plan to deliver these objectives with specific project work.

## Improving the Angular developer experience

### Developer velocity

<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="Deliver Angular Signals" href="https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49685">
  This project rethinks the Angular reactivity model by introducing Signals as a reactivity primitive. The initial planning resulted in hundreds of discussions, conversations with developers, feedback sessions, user experience studies, and a series of RFCs, which received over 1,000 comments.

  As part of the v17 release, we graduated the Angular Signals library from developer preview. In v19 we moved signal-based queries, inputs, and model inputs to stable. Next, we'll need to finalize effects before we complete this project.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Zoneless Angular" href="">
  In v18 we shipped experimental zoneless support in Angular. It enables developers to use the framework without including zone.js in their bundle, which improves performance, debugging experience, and interoperability. As part of the initial release we also introduced zoneless support to the Angular CDK and Angular Material.

  In v19 we introduced zoneless support in server-side rendering, addressed some edge cases, and created a schematic to scaffold zoneless projects. We transitioned <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to zoneless which improved performance, developer experience, and allowed us to identify gaps that we need to address before moving this feature to developer preview. Stay tuned for more updates in the next months.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Signal integrations" href="">
  We're working towards improving the integration of fundamental Angular packages, such as forms, HTTP, and router, with Signals. As part of this project, we'll seek opportunities to introduce convenient signal-based APIs or wrappers to improve the holistic developer experience.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Signal debugging in Angular DevTools" href="">
  With the evolution of Signals in Angular, we are working on a better tooling for debugging them. High on the priority list is a UI for inspecting and debugging signals.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Improve HMR (Hot Module Reload)" href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39367#issuecomment-1439537306">
  We're working towards faster edit/refresh cycle by enabling hot module replacement.
  
  In Angular v19 we shipped initial support for CSS and template HMR. We'll continue collecting feedback to make sure we're addressing developers' needs before we mark this project as complete.
  </docs-card>
</docs-card-container>

### Improve Angular Material and the CDK

<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="New CDK primitives" href="">
  We are working on new CDK primitives to facilitate creating custom components based on the WAI-ARIA design patterns for [Combobox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox). Angular v14 introduced stable [menu and dialog primitives](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) as part of this project, and in v15 Listbox.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Angular component accessibility" href="">
  We are evaluating components in Angular Material against accessibility standards such as WCAG and working to fix any issues that arise from this process.
  </docs-card>
</docs-card-container>

### Improve tooling

<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="Modernize unit testing tooling with ng test" href="">
  In v12, we revisited the Angular end-to-end testing experience by replacing Protractor with modern alternatives such as Cypress, Nightwatch, Puppeteer, Playwright, and Webdriver.io. Next, we'd like to tackle `ng test` to modernize Angular's unit testing experience.

  We're currently evaluating Web Test Runner, Vitest, and Jest as candidates for a new test runner for Angular projects while preserving Jasmine as assertion library to not break existing tests.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Evaluating Nitro support in the Angular CLI" href="https://nitro.unjs.io/">
  We're excited about the set of features that Nitro offers such as more deployment options, improved compatibility of server-side rendering with different runtimes and file-based routing. In 2025 we'll evaluate how it fits in the Angular server-side rendering model.

  We'll share updates as we make progress in this investigation.
  </docs-card>
</docs-card-container>

## Fast by default

<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="Enable incremental hydration" href="">
  In v17 we graduated hydration from developer preview and we've been consistently observing 40-50% improvements in LCP. Since then we started prototyping incremental hydration and shared a demo on stage at ng-conf.
  
  In v19 we shipped the incremental hydration in developer preview mode, powered by `@defer` blocks. Give it a try and <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues">share your feedback</a> with us!
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Server route configuration" href="">
  We're working towards enabling a more ergonomic route configuration on the server. We want to make it trivial to declare which routes should be server-side rendered, prerendered or client-side rendered.

  In Angular v19 we shipped developer preview of route-level render mode which allows you to granularly configure which routes you want Angular to prerender, server-side render or client-side render. 
  </docs-card>
</docs-card-container>

## Future work, explorations, and prototyping

This section represents explorations and prototyping of potential future projects. A reasonable outcome is to decide that our current solutions are the best options. Other projects may result in RFCs, graduating to in-progress projects, or being deprioritized as the web continues to innovate along with our framework.

<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="Signal Forms" href="">
  We plan to analyze existing feedback about Angular forms and design a solution which addresses developers' requirements and uses Signals for management of reactive state.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Selectorless" href="">
  To reduce boilerplate and improve the ergonomics of standalone components we are now designing a solution that will make selectors optional. To use a component or directive you'll be able to import it and directly use it in a component's template.

  We're still in early stages of planning selectorless. We'll share a request for comments when we have an early design and we're ready for next steps.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Exploration of streamed server-side rendering" href="">
  Over the past few releases we've been working on making Angular's server-side rendering story more robust. On our priority list is to explore streamed server-side rendering for zoneless application.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Investigation for authoring format improvements" href="">
  Based on our developer surveys' results we saw there are opportunities for improving the ergonomics of the component authoring format. The first step of the process will be to gather requirements and understand the problem space in advanced to an RFC. We'll share updates as we make progress. High priority in the future work will be backward compatibility and interoperability.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Improve TestBed" href="">
  Based on feedback over the years and the recent updates in Angular's runtime, we'll evaluate TestBed to identify opportunities to improve developer experience and reduce boilerplate when developing unit tests.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Incremental adoption" href="">
  Angular has been lacking the tools and the flexibility to add interactivity to a multi-page app or embed an Angular component inside of an existing app built with a different framework.

  As part of this project, we'll explore the requirement space of cross framework interop and our build tooling offering to make this use case possible.
