You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Don't use explicit `standalone: true` (it is implied by default)
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.

## Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- DO NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

## State Management
- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable

## Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables

## Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## Routing
- Use `provideRouter()` with standalone components instead of `RouterModule.forRoot()`/`.forChild()`.
- Implement lazy loading by default for all routes using loadComponent for standalone components.
- Use functional route guards (`CanActivateFn`, `CanDeactivateFn`) instead of class-based guards
- Configure preloading strategies with a data-driven approach:
  - Default to `NoPreloading` to ensure the fastest initial load and conserve user bandwidth.
  - Only consider other strategies, like `PreloadAllModules` or a custom one, after analyzing user traffic patterns to identify common navigation paths. Avoid enabling aggressive preloading based on assumptions.
- Structure routes hierarchically with clear parent-child relationships
