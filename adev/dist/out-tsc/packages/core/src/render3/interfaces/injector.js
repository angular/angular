 * Each injector is saved in 9 contiguous slots in `LView` and 9 contiguous slots in

 * can be shared in `TView`) as well as the tokens of its ancestor nodes (which cannot be
 * shared, so they live in `LView`).
 *
 * Each of these slots (aside from the last slot) contains a bloom filter. This bloom filter
 * determines whether a directive is available on the associated node or not. This prevents us

 *
 * See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter for more about bloom filters.
 *

 * using interfaces as they were previously. The start index of each `LInjector` and `TInjector`
 * will differ based on where it is flattened into the main array, so it's not possible to know
 * the indices ahead of time and save their types here. The interfaces are still included here

 * - One with `multi` values, (rare).

 * Since VMs can cache up to 4 inline hidden classes this is OK.
 *
 * - Single factory: Only `resolving` and `factory` is defined.
 * - `providers` factory: `componentProviders` is a number and `index = -1`.
 * - `viewProviders` factory: `componentProviders` is a number and `index` points to `providers`.

   *
   * If we have a component and directive active an a single element as declared here

   * component:
   *   providers: [ {provide: String, useValue: 'component', multi: true} ],

   *
   * ```ts
   * providers: ['component', 'directive']
   * viewProviders: ['component', 'componentView', 'directive']

   * The way to think about it is that the `viewProviders` have been inserted after the component
   * but before the directives, which is why we need to know how many `multi`s have been declared by
   * the component.

   * `all`) are the exact same instance in both the content as well as the view injection. (We
   * have to make sure that we don't double instantiate.) For this reason the `viewProviders`
   * `Factory` has a pointer to the shadowed `providers` factory so that it can instantiate the
   * `providers` (`['all']`) and then extend it with `viewProviders` (`['all'] + ['viewOnly'] =
   * ['all', 'viewOnly']`).
