 * This class was mostly used as a part of ViewEngine-based JIT API and is no longer needed in Ivy
 * JIT mode. Angular provides APIs that accept NgModule classes directly (such as
 * [PlatformRef.bootstrapModule](api/core/PlatformRef#bootstrapModule) and
 * [createNgModule](api/core/createNgModule)), consider switching to those APIs instead of
 * using factory-based ones.
