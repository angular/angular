## Local Development

For local development, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is the preferred package manager. You can set up a local environment with the following commands
:

```bash
# Clone Angular repo
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd angular

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Build and run local dev server
# Note: Initial build will take some time
yarn docs
```

If you are having issues with the docs building, see the [FAQs](#faqs) section.

## FAQs

### The build is failing and I'm seeing `bazel:bazel failed: missing input file` messages.

This is most likely due to a bazel dependency / caching issue. To resolve this, run the following command:

```
# Try this first
yarn bazel clean

# If that doesn't work, try it with the expunge flag
yarn bazel clean --expunge
```
