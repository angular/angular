        The Angular team can't provide general troubleshooting help. However, the extended community of users can provide more help:
        - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-material2)
        - [Gitter](https://gitter.im/angular/material2)
        - [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular-material2)

        Issues should capture only bug reports and feature requests. However, we understand that it is not always clear whether an issue is caused by a bug or incorrect usage of a feature/component.
        Most support requests will be automatically closed. If the answer is quickly obvious, though, we might be able to provide a brief answer.
