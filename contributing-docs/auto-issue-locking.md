# Automatic conversation locking

Closed issues and pull requests are locked automatically after 30 days of inactivity.

## I want to comment on a locked conversation, what should I do?

When an issue has been closed and inactive for over 30 days, the original context is likely
outdated.
If you encounter a similar or related issue in the current version, please open a new issue and
provide up-to-date reproduction instructions.

## Why lock conversations?

Automatically locking closed, inactive issues guides people towards filing new issues with updated
context rather than commenting on a "resolved" issue that contains out-of-date or unrelated
information. As an example, someone may comment "I'm still having this issue", but without
providing any of the additional information the team needs to investigate.
