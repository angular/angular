DESCRIPTION='
  Builds and runs the command generated by "bazel run" in the calling
  terminal. The command is run as a grandchild of the current shell,
  not from the Bazel server. Therefore, the program will have a controlling terminal, and
  the Bazel lock is released before running the command.'
