# This .bazelrc file contains some  of the flags required for the provided
# toolchain with Remote Build Execution. Specifically, it includes all flags
# except toolchain/platform flags.

# Depending on how many machines are in the remote execution instance, setting
# this higher can make builds faster by allowing more jobs to run in parallel.
# Setting it too high can result in jobs that timeout, however, while waiting
# for a remote machine to execute them.
build:remote --jobs=50

# Set various strategies so that all actions execute remotely. Mixing remote
# and local execution will lead to errors unless the toolchain and remote
# machine exactly match the host machine.
build:remote --spawn_strategy=remote
build:remote --strategy=Javac=remote
build:remote --strategy=Closure=remote
build:remote --strategy=Genrule=remote
build:remote --define=EXECUTOR=remote

# Enable the remote cache so action results can be shared across machines,
# developers, and workspaces.
build:remote --remote_cache=remotebuildexecution.googleapis.com

# Enable remote execution so actions are performed on the remote systems.
build:remote --remote_executor=remotebuildexecution.googleapis.com

# Enable encryption.
build:remote --tls_enabled=true

# Set a higher timeout value, just in case.
build:remote --remote_timeout=3600

# Enable authentication. This will pick up application default credentials by
# default. You can use --auth_credentials=some_file.json to use a service
# account credential instead.
build:remote --auth_enabled=true
