/*
 * NodeJS resolver that enables the interop with the current Bazel setup.
 *
 * The loader will attempt resolution by replacing explicit extension with
 * their ESM variants. It also tries completing import specifiers in case no
 * extension of explicit file is specified.
 *
 * There are a few cases:
 *
 *   * Relative imports without an extension. This happens because our
 *     source files cannot use explicit `.mjs` extensions yet.
 *   * Relative imports with an explicit extension to `.js`. This may
 *     be generated by TypeScript as we have `.ts` source files.
 *   * Local module imports. In NPM, extensions are not needed as the
 *     `package.json` `exports` help resolving. In Bazel when dealing with
 *     1st-party packages- `package.json` is not consulted in resolution.
 *        1. The NPM artifacts differ from the source compilation output.
 *        2. It results in additional churn, having to put `package.json` into `bin`.
