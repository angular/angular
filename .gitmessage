# Example Commit Messages
# =======================


# ─── Example: Simple refactor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# refactor(core): rename refreshDynamicEmbeddedViews to refreshEmbeddedViews
#
# Improve code readability. The original name no longer matches how the function is used.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤


# ─── Example: Simple docs change ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# docs: clarify the service limitation in providers.md guide
#
# Fixes #36332
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤


# ─── Example: A bug fix ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# fix(ngcc): ensure lockfile is removed when `analyzeFn` fails
#
# Previously an error thrown in the `analyzeFn` would cause the ngcc process to exit immediately
# without removing the lockfile, and potentially before the unlocker process had been successfully
# spawned resulting in the lockfile being orphaned and left behind.
#
# Now we catch these errors and remove the lockfile as needed.

# ─── Example: Breaking change ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# feat(bazel): simplify ng_package by dropping esm5 and fesm5
#
# esm5 and fesm5 distributions are no longer needed and have been deprecated in the past.
#
# https://v9.angular.io/guide/deprecations#esm5-and-fesm5-code-formats-in-angular-npm-packages
#
# This commit modifies ng_package to no longer distribute these two formats in npm packages built by
# ng_package (e.g. @angular/core).
#
# This commit intentionally doesn't fully clean up the ng_package rule to remove all traces of esm5
# and fems5 build artifacts as that is a bigger cleanup and currently we are narrowing down the
# scope of this change to the MVP needed for v10, which in this case is 'do not put esm5 and fesm5'
# into the npm packages.
#
# More cleanup to follow: https://angular-team.atlassian.net/browse/FW-2143
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: esm5 and fesm5 format is no longer distributed in Angular's npm packages e.g.
# @angular/core
#
# Angular CLI will automatically downlevel the code to es5 if differential loading is enabled in the
# Angular project, so no action is required from Angular CLI users.
#
# If you are not using Angular CLI to build your application or library, and you need to be able to
# build es5 artifacts, then you will need to downlevel the distributed Angular code to es5 on your
# own.
#
#
# Fixes #1234
