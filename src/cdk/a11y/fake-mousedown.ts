 * Screenreaders will often fire fake mousedown events when a focusable element
 * is activated using the keyboard. We can typically distinguish between these faked
 * mousedown events and real mousedown events using the "buttons" property. While
 * real mousedowns will indicate the mouse button that was pressed (e.g. "1" for
 * the left mouse button), faked mousedowns will usually set the property value to 0.
