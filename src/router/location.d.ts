import { LocationStrategy } from './location_strategy';
/**
 * `Location` is a service that applications can use to interact with a browser's URL.
 * Depending on which {@link LocationStrategy} is used, `Location` will either persist
 * to the URL's path or the URL's hash segment.
 *
 * Note: it's better to use {@link Router#navigate} service to trigger route changes. Use
 * `Location` only if you need to interact with or create normalized URLs outside of
 * routing.
 *
 * `Location` is responsible for normalizing the URL against the application's base href.
 * A normalized URL is absolute from the URL host, includes the application's base href, and has no
 * trailing slash:
 * - `/my/app/user/123` is normalized
 * - `my/app/user/123` **is not** normalized
 * - `/my/app/user/123/` **is not** normalized
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
 * import {
 *   ROUTER_DIRECTIVES,
 *   ROUTER_PROVIDERS,
 *   RouteConfig,
 *   Location
 * } from 'angular2/router';
 *
 * @Component({directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES]})
 * @RouteConfig([
 *  {...},
 * ])
 * class AppCmp {
 *   constructor(location: Location) {
 *     location.go('/foo');
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * bootstrap(AppCmp, [ROUTER_PROVIDERS]);
 * ```
