<!-- Template vars on <template> elements can't be accessed _in_ the template because Angular
    doesn't support grabbing the instance / TemplateRef this way because the variable may be
    referring to something *in* the template (such as #item in ngFor). As such, the component
    has to use @ViewChild / @ViewChildren to get these references.
    See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7158 -->
