 * Create trace scope.
 *
 * Scopes must be strictly nested and are analogous to stack frames, but
 * do not have to follow the stack frames. Instead it is recommended that they follow logical
 * nesting. You may want to use
 * [Event
 * Signatures](http://google.github.io/tracing-framework/instrumenting-code.html#custom-events)
 * as they are defined in WTF.
 *
 * Used to mark scope entry. The return value is used to leave the scope.
 *
 *     var myScope = wtfCreateScope('MyClass#myMethod(ascii someVal)');
 *
 *     someMethod() {
 *        var s = myScope('Foo'); // 'Foo' gets stored in tracing UI
 *        // DO SOME WORK HERE
 *        return wtfLeave(s, 123); // Return value 123
 *     }
 *
 * Note, adding try-finally block around the work to ensure that `wtfLeave` gets called can
 * negatively impact the performance of your application. For this reason we recommend that
 * you don't add them to ensure that `wtfLeave` gets called. In production `wtfLeave` is a noop and
 * so try-finally block has no value. When debugging perf issues, skipping `wtfLeave`, do to
 * exception, will produce incorrect trace, but presence of exception signifies logic error which
 * needs to be fixed before the app should be profiled. Add try-finally only when you expect that
 * an exception is expected during normal execution while profiling.
