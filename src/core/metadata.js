/**
 * Declare reusable UI building blocks for an application.
 *
 * Each Angular component requires a single `@Component` and at least one `@View` annotation. The
 * `@Component`
 * annotation specifies when a component is instantiated, and which properties and hostListeners it
 * binds to.
 *
 * When a component is instantiated, Angular
 * - creates a shadow DOM for the component.
 * - loads the selected template into the shadow DOM.
 * - creates all the injectable objects configured with `providers` and `viewProviders`.
 *
 * All template expressions and statements are then evaluated against the component instance.
 *
 * For details on the `@View` annotation, see {@link ViewMetadata}.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle hooks
 *
 * When the component class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are
 * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the component.

// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc. It is copied from DirectiveMetadata.
/**
 * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.
 *
 * {@link DirectiveMetadata}s with an embedded view are called {@link ComponentMetadata}s.
 *
 * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the
 * directive's `selector` matches
 * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:
 *
 * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor
 * arguments.
 * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a
 * depth-first order,
 *    as declared in the HTML.
 *
 * ## Understanding How Injection Works
 *
 * There are three stages of injection resolution.
 * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:
 *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if
 * the dependency was
 *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.
 *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,
 * location, and others.
 * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow
 * the same parent-child hierarchy
 *     as the component instances in the DOM.
 * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each
 * element has an `ElementInjector`
 *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.
 *
 * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a
 * depth-first order. The
 * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.
 *
 * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the
 * {@link ViewMetadata}:
 *
 * 1. Dependencies on the current element
 * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary
 * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component
 * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors
 *
 *
 * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can
 * delegate to the parent
 * injector.
 *
 * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:
 * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only
 * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current
 * element and the
 *    Shadow DOM root.
 * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child
 * directives.
 * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any
 * child directives.
 *
 * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:
 * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.
 * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for
 * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only
 * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in
 * practice.
 *
 *
 * Assume this HTML template:
 *
 * ```
 * <div dependency="1">
 *   <div dependency="2">
 *     <div dependency="3" my-directive>
 *       <div dependency="4">
 *         <div dependency="5"></div>
 *       </div>
 *       <div dependency="6"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.
 *
 * ```
 * @Injectable()
 * class SomeService {
 * }
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: '[dependency]',
 *   inputs: [
 *     'id: dependency'
 *   ]
 * })
 * class Dependency {
 *   id:string;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...
 *
 *
 * ### No injection
 *
 * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into
 * `MyDirective`.
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor() {
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.
 *
 *
 * ### Component-level injection
 *
 * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its
 * parents.
 *
 * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type
 * from the parent
 * component's injector.
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.
 *
 *
 * ### Injecting a directive from the current element
 *
 * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {
 *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case
 * `dependency="3"`.
 *
 * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements
 *
 * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow
 * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the
 * parent element, or its parents.
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {
 *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If
 * `dependency="2"` didn't
 * exist on the direct parent, this injection would
 * have returned
 * `dependency="1"`.
 *
 *
 * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives
 *
 *
 * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated
 * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,
 * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,
 * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an
 * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and
 * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.
 *
 * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives
 *
 * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child
 * elements.
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.
 *
 * ### Optional injection
 *
 * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be
 * resolved. If you
 * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency
 * with `@Optional()`.
 * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as
 * optional.
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
 * class MyDirective {
 *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.
 * If none can be
 * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: '[tooltip]',
 *   inputs: [
 *     'text: tooltip'
 *   ],
 *   host: {
 *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',
 *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'
 *   }
 * })
 * class Tooltip{
 *   text:string;
 *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 *
 *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {
 *     this.overlay = overlay;
 *   }
 *
 *   onMouseEnter() {
 *     // exact signature to be determined
 *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);
 *   }
 *
 *   onMouseLeave() {
 *     this.overlay.close();
 *     this.overlay = null;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the
 * `tooltip` selector,
 * like so:
 *
 * ```
 * <div tooltip="some text here"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template
 * elements:
 *
 * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at
 * runtime.
 * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a
 * location in the current view
 * where these actions are performed.
 *
 * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the
 * `<template>` element. Thus a
 * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.
 *
 * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full
 * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular
 * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo="bar">` and `<li template="foo: bar">` are
 * equivalent.
 *
 * Thus,
 *
 * ```
 * <ul>
 *   <li *foo="bar" title="text"></li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Expands in use to:
 *
 * ```
 * <ul>
 *   <template [foo]="bar">
 *     <li title="text"></li>
 *   </template>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo="bar"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for
 * the directive
 * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle hooks
 *
 * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are
 * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.
 *
 * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: '[unless]',
 *   inputs: ['unless']
 * })
 * export class Unless {
 *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;
 *   templateRef: TemplateRef;
 *   prevCondition: boolean;
 *
 *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {
 *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;
 *     this.templateRef = templateRef;
 *     this.prevCondition = null;
 *   }
 *
 *   set unless(newCondition) {
 *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {
 *       this.prevCondition = true;
 *       this.viewContainer.clear();
 *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {
 *       this.prevCondition = false;
 *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:
 * ```
 * <ul>
 *   <li *unless="expr"></li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands
 * and the result is:
 *
 * ```
 * <ul>
 *   <template [unless]="exp">
 *     <li></li>
 *   </template>
 *   <li></li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,
 * the instantiated
 * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.

/**
 * Declares an injectable parameter to be a live list of directives or variable
 * bindings from the content children of a directive.
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/lY9m8HLy7z06vDoUaSN2?p=preview))
 *
 * Assume that `<tabs>` component would like to get a list its children `<pane>`
 * components as shown in this example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <tabs>
 *   <pane title="Overview">...</pane>
 *   <pane *ngFor="#o of objects" [title]="o.title">{{o.text}}</pane>
 * </tabs>
 * ```
 *
 * The preferred solution is to query for `Pane` directives using this decorator.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'pane',
 *   inputs: ['title']
 * })
 * class Pane {
 *   title:string;
 * }
 *
 * @Component({
 *  selector: 'tabs',
 *  template: `
 *    <ul>
 *      <li *ngFor="#pane of panes">{{pane.title}}</li>
 *    </ul>
 *    <content></content>
 *  `
 * })
 * class Tabs {
 *   panes: QueryList<Pane>;
 *   constructor(@Query(Pane) panes:QueryList<Pane>) {
 *     this.panes = panes;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A query can look for variable bindings by passing in a string with desired binding symbol.
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/sT2j25cH1dURAyBRCKx1?p=preview))
 * ```html
 * <seeker>
 *   <div #findme>...</div>
 * </seeker>
 *
 * @Component({ selector: 'foo' })
 * class seeker {
 *   constructor(@Query('findme') elList: QueryList<ElementRef>) {...}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In this case the object that is injected depend on the type of the variable
 * binding. It can be an ElementRef, a directive or a component.
 *
 * Passing in a comma separated list of variable bindings will query for all of them.
 *
 * ```html
 * <seeker>
 *   <div #findMe>...</div>
 *   <div #findMeToo>...</div>
 * </seeker>
 *
 *  @Component({
 *   selector: 'foo'
 * })
 * class Seeker {
 *   constructor(@Query('findMe, findMeToo') elList: QueryList<ElementRef>) {...}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Configure whether query looks for direct children or all descendants
 * of the querying element, by using the `descendants` parameter.
 * It is set to `false` by default.
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/wtGeB977bv7qvA5FTYl9?p=preview))
 * ```html
 * <container #first>
 *   <item>a</item>
 *   <item>b</item>
 *   <container #second>
 *     <item>c</item>
 *   </container>
 * </container>
 * ```
 *
 * When querying for items, the first container will see only `a` and `b` by default,
 * but with `Query(TextDirective, {descendants: true})` it will see `c` too.
 *
 * The queried directives are kept in a depth-first pre-order with respect to their
 * positions in the DOM.
 *
 * Query does not look deep into any subcomponent views.
 *
 * Query is updated as part of the change-detection cycle. Since change detection
 * happens after construction of a directive, QueryList will always be empty when observed in the
 * constructor.
 *
 * The injected object is an unmodifiable live list.
 * See {@link QueryList} for more details.

/**
 * Declares a host property binding.
 *
 * Angular automatically checks host property bindings during change detection.
 * If a binding changes, it will update the host element of the directive.
 *
 * `HostBindingMetadata` takes an optional parameter that specifies the property
 * name of the host element that will be updated. When not provided,
 * the class property name is used.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following example creates a directive that sets the `valid` and `invalid` classes
 * on the DOM element that has ngModel directive on it.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Directive({selector: '[ngModel]'})
 * class NgModelStatus {
 *   constructor(public control:NgModel) {}
 *   @HostBinding('[class.valid]') get valid { return this.control.valid; }
 *   @HostBinding('[class.invalid]') get invalid { return this.control.invalid; }
 * }
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'app',
 *   template: `<input [(ngModel)]="prop">`,
 *   directives: [FORM_DIRECTIVES, NgModelStatus]
 * })
 * class App {
 *   prop;
 * }
 *
 * bootstrap(App);
 * ```

// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc. It is copied from HostListenerMetadata.
/**
 * Declares a host listener.
 *
 * Angular will invoke the decorated method when the host element emits the specified event.
 *
 * If the decorated method returns `false`, then `preventDefault` is applied on the DOM
 * event.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following example declares a directive that attaches a click listener to the button and
 * counts clicks.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Directive({selector: 'button[counting]'})
 * class CountClicks {
 *   numberOfClicks = 0;
 *
 *   @HostListener('click', ['$event.target'])
 *   onClick(btn) {
 *     console.log("button", btn, "number of clicks:", this.numberOfClicks++);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'app',
 *   template: `<button counting>Increment</button>`,
 *   directives: [CountClicks]
 * })
 * class App {}
 *
 * bootstrap(App);
