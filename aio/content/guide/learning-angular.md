Everyone learns differently.
You don't have to read the documentation straight through.  Most pages stand on their own.
Those new to Angular may wish to follow this popular learning path.
<br class="l-clear-left">

1. [Setup](setup.html "Setup locally withe Quickstart seed") for local Angular development, if you haven't already done so.

1. Take the [*Tour of Heroes* tutorial](../tutorial "Tour of Heroes").

  The *Tour of Heroes* takes you step-by-step from [setup](setup.html)
  to a full-featured example that demonstrates the essential characteristics of a professional application:
  a sensible project structure, data binding, master/detail, services, dependency injection, navigation, and remote data access.

1. <a id="architecture"></a>Read the [Architecture](architecture.html) overview for the big picture.

1. [The Root Module](appmodule.html) introduces the `NgModule` class that tells Angular how to compile and run your application.

1. [Displaying Data](displaying-data.html) shows how data binding puts component property values on screen.

1. [User Input](user-input.html) explains how to respond to user-initiated DOM events.

1. [Forms](forms.html) covers data entry and validation within the UI.

1. [Dependency Injection](dependency-injection.html) is the way to build large, maintainable applications
from small, single-purpose parts.

1. [Template Syntax](template-syntax.html) is a comprehensive study of Angular template HTML.

After reading the above sections, feel free to skip around among the other pages on this site.

### Next Step

Try the [tutorial](../tutorial "Tour of Heroes") if you're ready to start coding or
visit the [Architecture](architecture.html "Basic Concepts") page if you prefer to learn the basic concepts first.
