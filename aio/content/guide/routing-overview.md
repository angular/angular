# Angular Routing

In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page.
As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the different [views](guide/glossary#view "Definition of view") that you have defined.

To handle the navigation from one [view](guide/glossary#view) to the next, you use the Angular **`Router`**.
The **`Router`** enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.

To explore a sample app featuring the router's primary features, see the <live-example stackblitz="router"></live-example>.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a route, you should be familiar with the following:

* [Basics of components](guide/architecture-components)
* [Basics of templates](guide/glossary#template)
* An Angular app&mdash;you can generate a basic Angular app using the [Angular CLI](cli).
