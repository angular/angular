# Update Angular to v14

This guide contains information to update to Angular version 14.

## Update Angular CLI applications

For step-by-step instructions on how to update to the latest Angular release and leverage the Angular automated migration tools, use the interactive update guide at [update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io).

## Changes and deprecations in version 14

<div class="alert is-helpful">

For information about the deprecation and removal practices of Angular, see [Angular Release Practices](guide/releases#deprecation-practices).

</div>

*   **Strictly Typed Reactive Forms**

    The Reactive Forms types `AbstractControl`, `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray` now support a generic parameter which allows for strict typing of the controls. An automatic migration will convert existing usages of these types to special `Untyped` aliases which preserve the existing behavior.

    The `initialValueIsDefault` option for `FormControl` construction has been deprecated in favor of the `nonNullable` option (which has identical behavior). This renaming aligns the `FormControl` constructor with other strictly typed APIs related to nullability.

*   **`ComponentFactory` and `NgModuleFactory` cleanup**

    Many APIs which use either `ComponentFactory` or `NgModuleFactory` have been deprecated and replaced with new APIs that use component or NgModule classes directly.
