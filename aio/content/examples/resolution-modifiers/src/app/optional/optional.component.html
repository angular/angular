<div class="section">
	<h2>&#64;Optional() Component</h2>
	<p>This component still works even though the OptionalService (notice &#64;Optional() in the constructor isn't provided or configured anywhere. Angular goes through tree and visibility rules, and if it doesn't find the requested service, returns null.</p>
