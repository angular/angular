Cookbook

@intro
A collection of recipes for common Angular application scenarios

@description
The *Cookbook* offers answers to common implementation questions.

Each cookbook chapter is a collection of recipes focused on a particular Angular feature or application challenge
such as data binding, cross-component interaction, and communicating with a remote server via HTTP.

The cookbook is just getting started. Many more recipes are on the way.
Each cookbook chapter links to a live sample with every recipe included.

Recipes are deliberately brief and code-centric. 
Each recipe links to a chapter of the Developer Guide or the API Guide
where you can learn more about the purpose, context, and design choices behind the code snippets.
