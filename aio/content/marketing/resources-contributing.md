## About this list

<!-- vale Angular.Google_We = NO -->

We maintain a small list of some of the top Angular resources from across the community, stored in `resources.json`. This list is not intended to be comprehensive, but to act as a starting point to connect Angular developers to the rest of the community.

## How do you get listed?

While we can't accept all contributions, qualifying contributions can be submitted via a PR adding yourself to the `resources.json` file. All contributions should be in the appropriate section and must meet the following criteria:

1.  Your contribution must be valid, and contain a link to a page talking specifically about using Angular
1.  Your contribution should have a clear and concise title and description
1.  Your resource should follow our brand guidelines \(see our [Press kit](presskit)\)
1.  Your resource should have significant benefit to Angular developers
1.  Your resource should already have traction and praise from Angular developers
