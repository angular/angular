## Benchmarks script

This folder contains a convenience script for running benchmarks and performing comparisons. It can
be run via `yarn benchmarks`. See command line help for possible commands.

The benchmark script is used in conjunction with the benchmark compare GitHub actions workflow, allowing
organization members to initiate a benchmark comparison via a GitHub comment in a PR.
