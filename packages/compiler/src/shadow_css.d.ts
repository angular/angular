     * Process styles to add scope to keyframes.

     * animation rules using them.
     *
     * Animation rules using keyframes defined elsewhere are not modified to allow for globally
     * defined keyframes.
     *
     * For example, we convert this css:
     *
     * ```scss
     * .box {
     *   animation: box-animation 1s forwards;
     * }
     *

     * }
     * ```
     *
     * to this:
     *
     * ```scss
     * .box {
     *   animation: scopeName_box-animation 1s forwards;
     * }
     *
     * @keyframes scopeName_box-animation {
     *   to {
     *     background-color: green;
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @param cssText the component's css text that needs to be scoped.
     * @param scopeSelector the component's scope selector.
     *
     * @returns the scoped css text.

     * ```scss

     * any scoping selectors from them. For more information: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3
