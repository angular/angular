/**
 * Optimize variables declared and used in the IR.
 *
 * Variables are eagerly generated by pipeline stages for all possible values that could be
 * referenced. This stage processes the list of declared variables and all variable usages,
 * and optimizes where possible. It performs 3 main optimizations:
 *
 *   * It transforms variable declarations to side effectful expressions when the
 *     variable is not used, but its initializer has global effects which other
 *     operations rely upon.
 *   * It removes variable declarations if those variables are not referenced and
 *     either they do not have global effects, or nothing relies on them.
 *   * It inlines variable declarations when those variables are only used once
 *     and the inlining is semantically safe.
 *
 * To guarantee correctness, analysis of "fences" in the instruction lists is used to determine
 * which optimizations are safe to perform.
