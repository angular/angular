# What is the 'annotations/directive' package?

This package implements the `DirectiveDecoratorHandler`, which processes and compiles `@Directive`-decorated classes.

Directive compilation is also the base of component compilation, and so this package exports a number of utilities related to directive compilation for the 'annotations/component' package to use.
