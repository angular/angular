/**
 * A host for the aliasing system, which allows for alternative exports/imports of directives/pipes.
 *
 * Given an import of an NgModule (e.g. `CommonModule`), the compiler must generate imports to the
 * directives and pipes exported by this module (e.g. `NgIf`) when they're used in a particular
 * template. In its default configuration, if the compiler is not directly able to import the
 * component from another file within the same project, it will attempt to import the component
 * from the same (absolute) path by which the module was imported. So in the above example if
 * `CommonModule` was imported from '@angular/common', the compiler will attempt to import `NgIf`
 * from '@angular/common' as well.
 *
 * The aliasing system interacts with the above logic in two distinct ways.
 *
 * 1) It can be used to create "alias" re-exports from different files, which can be used when the
 *    user hasn't exported the directive(s) from the ES module containing the NgModule. These re-
 *    exports can also be helpful when using a `UnifiedModulesHost`, which overrides the import
 *    logic described above.
 *
 * 2) It can be used to get an alternative import expression for a directive or pipe, instead of
 *    the import that the normal logic would apply. The alias used depends on the provenance of the
 *    `Reference` which was obtained for the directive/pipe, which is usually a property of how it
 *    came to be in a template's scope (e.g. by which NgModule).
 *
 * See the README.md for more information on how aliasing works within the compiler.
