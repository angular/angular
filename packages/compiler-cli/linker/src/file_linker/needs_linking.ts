 * Determines if the provided source file may need to be processed by the linker, i.e. whether it
 * potentially contains any declarations. If true is returned, then the source file should be
 * processed by the linker as it may contain declarations that need to be fully compiled. If false
 * is returned, parsing and processing of the source file can safely be skipped to improve
 * performance.

 * that need to be compiled.

 * needed.
 * @param source the source file content as a string.
 * @returns whether the source file may contain declarations that need to be linked.
