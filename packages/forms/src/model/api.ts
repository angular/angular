/**
 * Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.

 *
 * @see `AbstractControl`
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 * @see [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)
 *
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Initializing Form Controls
 *
 * Instantiate a `FormControl`, with an initial value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'some value'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a form state object. The `value`
 * and `disabled` keys are required in this case.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl({ value: 'n/a', disabled: true });
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(control.status);    // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a synchronous validator.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(control.value);      // ''
 * console.log(control.status);     // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control using an options object.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a blur event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'blur'` to update on the blur `event`.
 *
 * ```ts

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of a group of `FormControl` instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the status values
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormArray`.
 *
 * When instantiating a `FormGroup`, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child registers the name for the control.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create a form group with 2 controls
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form group with a group-level validator
 *
 * You include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like `FormControl` instances, you choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, { validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form group
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *   one: new FormControl()
 * }, { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
