 * 3. TODO: A component that provides a ControlValueAccessor. This should only be used to backwards
 *    compatibility with reactive forms. Prefer options (1) and (2).
 *
 * This directive has several responsibilities:
 * 1. Two-way binds the field's value with the UI control's value
 * 2. Binds additional forms related state on the field to the UI control (disabled, required, etc.)
 * 3. Relays relevant events on the control to the field (e.g. marks field touched on blur)
 * 4. TODO: Provides a fake `NgControl` that implements a subset of the features available on the
 *    reactive forms `NgControl`. This is provided to improve interoperability with controls
 *    designed to work with reactive forms. It should not be used by controls written for signal
 *    forms.
