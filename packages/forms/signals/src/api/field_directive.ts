 * Binds a form `FieldTree` to a UI control that edits it. A UI control can be one of several things:
 * 1. A native HTML input or textarea
 * 2. A signal forms custom control that implements `FormValueControl` or `FormCheckboxControl`
 * 3. TODO: https://github.com/orgs/angular/projects/60/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=131712274. A
 *    component that provides a ControlValueAccessor. This should only be used to backwards
 *    compatibility with reactive forms. Prefer options (1) and (2).
 *
 * This directive has several responsibilities:
 * 1. Two-way binds the field's value with the UI control's value
 * 2. Binds additional forms related state on the field to the UI control (disabled, required, etc.)
 * 3. Relays relevant events on the control to the field (e.g. marks field touched on blur)
 * 4. TODO: https://github.com/orgs/angular/projects/60/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=131712274.
 *    Provides a fake `NgControl` that implements a subset of the features available on the
 *    reactive forms `NgControl`. This is provided to improve interoperability with controls
 *    designed to work with reactive forms. It should not be used by controls written for signal
 *    forms.
