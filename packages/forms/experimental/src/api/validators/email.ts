/**
 * A regular expression that matches valid e-mail addresses.
 *
 * At a high level, this regexp matches e-mail addresses of the format `local-part@tld`, where:
 * - `local-part` consists of one or more of the allowed characters (alphanumeric and some
 *   punctuation symbols).
 * - `local-part` cannot begin or end with a period (`.`).
 * - `local-part` cannot be longer than 64 characters.
 * - `tld` consists of one or more `labels` separated by periods (`.`). For example `localhost` or
 *   `foo.com`.
 * - A `label` consists of one or more of the allowed characters (alphanumeric, dashes (`-`) and
 *   periods (`.`)).
 * - A `label` cannot begin or end with a dash (`-`) or a period (`.`).
 * - A `label` cannot be longer than 63 characters.
 * - The whole address cannot be longer than 254 characters.
 *
 * ## Implementation background
 *
 * This regexp was ported over from AngularJS (see there for git history):
 * https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/c133ef836/src/ng/directive/input.js#L27
 * It is based on the
 * [WHATWG version](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address) with
 * some enhancements to incorporate more RFC rules (such as rules related to domain names and the
 * lengths of different parts of the address). The main differences from the WHATWG version are:
 *   - Disallow `local-part` to begin or end with a period (`.`).
 *   - Disallow `local-part` length to exceed 64 characters.
 *   - Disallow total address length to exceed 254 characters.
 *
 * See [this commit](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/f3f5cf72e) for more details.
