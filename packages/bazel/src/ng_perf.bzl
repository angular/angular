# flag to control whether the `ng_module` rule produces performance tracing JSON files (in Ivy mode)
# as declared outputs.
#
# It does this via the `NgPerfInfo` provider and the `perf_flag` attriubute on `ng_module`. For more
# details, see: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html
