     * navigated to.
     * 2. During a navigation, redirects are applied, which might only apply to _part_ of the URL (due
     * to `UrlHandlingStrategy`).
     * 3. Just before activation, the raw `UrlTree` is updated to include the redirects on top of the
     * original raw URL.

     * Note that this is _only_ here to support `UrlHandlingStrategy.extract` and
     * `UrlHandlingStrategy.shouldProcessUrl`. Without those APIs, the current `UrlTree` would not
     * deviated from the raw `UrlTree`.

     * For `extract`, a raw `UrlTree` is needed because `extract` may only return part
     * of the navigation URL. Thus, the current `UrlTree` may only represent _part_ of the browser
     * URL. When a navigation gets cancelled and the router needs to reset the URL or a new navigation
     * occurs, it needs to know the _whole_ browser URL, not just the part handled by
     * `UrlHandlingStrategy`.
     * For `shouldProcessUrl`, when the return is `false`, the router ignores the navigation but
     * still updates the raw `UrlTree` with the assumption that the navigation was caused by the
     * location change listener due to a URL update by the AngularJS router. In this case, the router
     * still need to know what the browser's URL is for future navigations.
