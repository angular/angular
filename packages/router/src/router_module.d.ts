 * @description
 *
 * Adds directives and providers for in-app navigation among views defined in an application.
 * Use the Angular `Router` service to declaratively specify application states and manage state
 * transitions.
 *
 * You can import this NgModule multiple times, once for each lazy-loaded bundle.
 * However, only one `Router` service can be active.
 * To ensure this, there are two ways to register routes when importing this module:
 *
 * * The `forRoot()` method creates an `NgModule` that contains all the directives, the given
 * routes, and the `Router` service itself.
 * * The `forChild()` method creates an `NgModule` that contains all the directives and the given
 * routes, but does not include the `Router` service.
 *
 * @see [Routing and Navigation guide](guide/routing/common-router-tasks) for an
 * overview of how the `Router` service should be used.
