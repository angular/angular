Implements the Angular Router service , which enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks.

Defines the `Route` object that maps a URL path to a component, and the `RouterOutlet` directive
that you use to place a routed view in a template, as well as a complete API for configuring, querying, and controlling the router state.

Import `RouterModule` to use the Router service in your app.
