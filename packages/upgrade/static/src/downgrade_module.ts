/**
 * @description
 *
 * A helper function for creating an AngularJS module that can bootstrap an Angular module
 * "on-demand" (possibly lazily) when a {@link downgradeComponent downgraded component} needs to be
 * instantiated.
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](api?query=upgrade/static) library for hybrid upgrade apps that
 * support AOT compilation.*
 *
 * It allows loading/bootstrapping the Angular part of a hybrid application lazily and not having to
 * pay the cost up-front. For example, you can have an AngularJS application that uses Angular for
 * specific routes and only instantiate the Angular modules if/when the user visits one of these
 * routes.
 *
 * The Angular module will be bootstrapped once (when requested for the first time) and the same
 * reference will be used from that point onwards.
 *
 * `downgradeModule()` requires either an `NgModuleFactory`, `NgModule` class or a function:
 * - `NgModuleFactory`: If you pass an `NgModuleFactory`, it will be used to instantiate a module
 *   using `platformBrowser`'s {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapModuleFactory bootstrapModuleFactory()}.
 *   NOTE: this type of the argument is deprecated. Please either provide an `NgModule` class or a
 *   bootstrap function instead.
 * - `NgModule` class: If you pass an NgModule class, it will be used to instantiate a module
 *   using `platformBrowser`'s {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapModule bootstrapModule()}.
 * - `Function`: If you pass a function, it is expected to return a promise resolving to an
 *   `NgModuleRef`. The function is called with an array of extra {@link StaticProvider Providers}
 *   that are expected to be available from the returned `NgModuleRef`'s `Injector`.
 *
 * `downgradeModule()` returns the name of the created AngularJS wrapper module. You can use it to
 * declare a dependency in your main AngularJS module.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/lite/module.ts region="basic-how-to"}
 *
 * For more details on how to use `downgradeModule()` see
 * [Upgrading for Performance](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * Apart from `UpgradeModule`, you can use the rest of the `upgrade/static` helpers as usual to
 * build a hybrid application. Note that the Angular pieces (e.g. downgraded services) will not be
 * available until the downgraded module has been bootstrapped, i.e. by instantiating a downgraded
 * component.
 *
 * <div class="docs-alert docs-alert-important">
 *
 *   You cannot use `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` in the same hybrid application.<br />
 *   Use one or the other.
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * ### Differences with `UpgradeModule`
 *
 * Besides their different API, there are two important internal differences between
 * `downgradeModule()` and `UpgradeModule` that affect the behavior of hybrid applications:
 *
 * 1. Unlike `UpgradeModule`, `downgradeModule()` does not bootstrap the main AngularJS module
 *    inside the {@link NgZone Angular zone}.
 * 2. Unlike `UpgradeModule`, `downgradeModule()` does not automatically run a
 *    [$digest()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$digest) when changes are
 *    detected in the Angular part of the application.
 *
 * What this means is that applications using `UpgradeModule` will run change detection more
 * frequently in order to ensure that both frameworks are properly notified about possible changes.
 * This will inevitably result in more change detection runs than necessary.
 *
 * `downgradeModule()`, on the other side, does not try to tie the two change detection systems as
 * tightly, restricting the explicit change detection runs only to cases where it knows it is
 * necessary (e.g. when the inputs of a downgraded component change). This improves performance,
 * especially in change-detection-heavy applications, but leaves it up to the developer to manually
 * notify each framework as needed.
 *
 * For a more detailed discussion of the differences and their implications, see
 * [Upgrading for Performance](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade).
 *
 * <div class="docs-alert docs-alert-helpful">
 *
 *   You can manually trigger a change detection run in AngularJS using
 *   [scope.$apply(...)](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$apply) or
 *   [$rootScope.$digest()](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$digest).
 *
 *   You can manually trigger a change detection run in Angular using {@link NgZone#run
 *   ngZone.run(...)}.
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * ### Downgrading multiple modules
 *
 * It is possible to downgrade multiple modules and include them in an AngularJS application. In
 * that case, each downgraded module will be bootstrapped when an associated downgraded component or
 * injectable needs to be instantiated.
 *
 * Things to keep in mind, when downgrading multiple modules:
 *
 * - Each downgraded component/injectable needs to be explicitly associated with a downgraded
 *   module. See `downgradeComponent()` and `downgradeInjectable()` for more details.
 *
 * - If you want some injectables to be shared among all downgraded modules, you can provide them as
 *   `StaticProvider`s, when creating the `PlatformRef` (e.g. via `platformBrowser` or
 *   `platformBrowserDynamic`).
 *
 * - When using {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapmodule `bootstrapModule()`} or
 *   {@link PlatformRef#bootstrapmodulefactory `bootstrapModuleFactory()`} to bootstrap the
 *   downgraded modules, each one is considered a "root" module. As a consequence, a new instance
 *   will be created for every injectable provided in `"root"` (via
 *   {@link Injectable#providedIn `providedIn`}).
 *   If this is not your intention, you can have a shared module (that will act as act as the "root"
 *   module) and create all downgraded modules using that module's injector:
 *
 *   {@example upgrade/static/ts/lite-multi-shared/module.ts region="shared-root-module"}
