# @angular/localize schematic for `ng add`

This schematic will be executed when a Angular CLI user runs `ng add @angular/localize`.

It will search their `angular.json` file, and find polyfills and main files for server builders.
Then it will add the `@angular/localize/init` polyfill that `@angular/localize` needs to work.
