/**
 * @description
 *
 * A service that applications can use to interact with a browser's URL.
 *
 * Depending on the `LocationStrategy` used, `Location` persists
 * to the URL's path or the URL's hash segment.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * It's better to use the `Router.navigate()` service to trigger route changes. Use
 * `Location` only if you need to interact with or create normalized URLs outside of
 * routing.
 *
 * `Location` is responsible for normalizing the URL against the application's base href.
 * A normalized URL is absolute from the URL host, includes the application's base href, and has no
 * trailing slash:
 * - `/my/app/user/123` is normalized
 * - `my/app/user/123` **is not** normalized
 * - `/my/app/user/123/` **is not** normalized
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {@example common/location/ts/path_location_component.ts region='LocationComponent'}
 *
