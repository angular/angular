/**
 * `LocationStrategy` is responsible for representing and reading route state
 * from the browser's URL. Angular provides two strategies:
 * {@link HashLocationStrategy} and {@link PathLocationStrategy}.
 *
 * This is used under the hood of the {@link Location} service.
 *
 * Applications should use the {@link Router} or {@link Location} services to
 * interact with application route state.
 *
 * For instance, {@link HashLocationStrategy} produces URLs like
 * `http://example.com#/foo`, and {@link PathLocationStrategy} produces
 * `http://example.com/foo` as an equivalent URL.
 *
 * See these two classes for more.
