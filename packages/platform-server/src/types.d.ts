// Type definitions for `domino` and `xhr2`. These modules were previously referenced
// through `require`. We switched these to actual ESM imports in order to emit full-ESM
// as package output. To not introduce a dependency on the `domino` or `xhr2` types, we
// define local module typings and set them to `any`.
