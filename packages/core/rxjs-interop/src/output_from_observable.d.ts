/**
 * Declares an Angular output that is using an RxJS observable as a source
 * for events dispatched to parent subscribers.
 *
 * The behavior for an observable as source is defined as followed:
 *    1. New values are forwarded to the Angular output (next notifications).
 *    2. Errors notifications are not handled by Angular. You need to handle these manually.
 *       For example by using `catchError`.
 *    3. Completion notifications stop the output from emitting new values.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Initialize an output in your directive by declaring a
 * class field and initializing it with the `outputFromObservable()` function.
 *
 * ```ts
 * @Directive({..})
 * export class MyDir {
 *   nameChange$ = <some-observable>;
 *   nameChange = outputFromObservable(this.nameChange$);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @publicApi 19.0
