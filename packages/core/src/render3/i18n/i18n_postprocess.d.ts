 * Handles message string post-processing for internationalization.
 *
 * Handles message string post-processing by transforming it from intermediate
 * format (that might contain some markers that we need to replace) to the final
 * form, consumable by i18nStart instruction. Post processing steps include:
 *
 * 1. Resolve all multi-value cases (like [�*1:1��#2:1�|�#4:1�|�5�])
 * 2. Replace all ICU vars (like "VAR_PLURAL")
 * 3. Replace all placeholders used inside ICUs in a form of {PLACEHOLDER}
 * 4. Replace all ICU references with corresponding values (like �ICU_EXP_ICU_1�)
 *    in case multiple ICUs have the same placeholder name
 *
 * @param message Raw translation string for post processing
 * @param replacements Set of replacements that should be applied
 *
 * @returns Transformed string that can be consumed by i18nStart instruction
