/**
 * Resolves the providers which are defined in the DirectiveDef.
 *
 * When inserting the tokens and the factories in their respective arrays, we can assume that
 * this method is called first for the component (if any), and then for other directives on the same
 * node.
 * As a consequence,the providers are always processed in that order:
 * 1) The view providers of the component
 * 2) The providers of the component
 * 3) The providers of the other directives
 * This matches the structure of the injectables arrays of a view (for each node).
 * So the tokens and the factories can be pushed at the end of the arrays, except
 * in one case for multi providers.
 *
 * @param def the directive definition
 * @param providers: Array of `providers`.
 * @param viewProviders: Array of `viewProviders`.
