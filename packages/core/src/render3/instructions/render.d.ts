 * Syncs an LView instance with its blueprint if they have gotten out of sync.
 *
 * Typically, blueprints and their view instances should always be in sync, so the loop here
 * will be skipped. However, consider this case of two components side-by-side:
 *
 * App template:
 * ```html
 * <comp></comp>
 * <comp></comp>
 * ```
 *
 * The following will happen:
 * 1. App template begins processing.
 * 2. First <comp> is matched as a component and its LView is created.
 * 3. Second <comp> is matched as a component and its LView is created.
 * 4. App template completes processing, so it's time to check child templates.
 * 5. First <comp> template is checked. It has a directive, so its def is pushed to blueprint.
 * 6. Second <comp> template is checked. Its blueprint has been updated by the first
 * <comp> template, but its LView was created before this update, so it is out of sync.
 *
 * Note that embedded views inside ngFor loops will never be out of sync because these views
 * are processed as soon as they are created.
 *
 * @param tView The `TView` that contains the blueprint for syncing
 * @param lView The view to sync
