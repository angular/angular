 * Each injector is saved in 9 contiguous slots in `LView` and 9 contiguous slots in
 * `TView.data`. This allows us to store information about the current node's tokens (which
 * can be shared in `TView`) as well as the tokens of its ancestor nodes (which cannot be
 * shared, so they live in `LView`).
 *
 * Each of these slots (aside from the last slot) contains a bloom filter. This bloom filter
 * determines whether a directive is available on the associated node or not. This prevents us
 * from searching the directives array at this level unless it's probable the directive is in it.
 *
 * See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter for more about bloom filters.
 *
 * Because all injectors have been flattened into `LView` and `TViewData`, they cannot typed
 * using interfaces as they were previously. The start index of each `LInjector` and `TInjector`
 * will differ based on where it is flattened into the main array, so it's not possible to know
 * the indices ahead of time and save their types here. The interfaces are still included here
 * for documentation purposes.
