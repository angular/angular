/**
 * Service that keeps track of pending tasks contributing to the stableness of Angular
 * application. While several existing Angular services (ex.: `HttpClient`) will internally manage
 * tasks influencing stability, this API gives control over stability to library and application
 * developers for specific cases not covered by Angular internals.
 *
 * The concept of stability comes into play in several important scenarios:
 * - SSR process needs to wait for the application stability before serializing and sending rendered
 * HTML;
 * - tests might want to delay assertions until the application becomes stable;
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ```ts
 * const pendingTasks = inject(PendingTasks);
 * const taskCleanup = pendingTasks.add();
 * // do work that should block application's stability and then:
 * taskCleanup();
 * ```
 *
 * @publicApi 20.0
