      Script tag which bootstraps the application. Use `?debug` in URL to select
      the debug version of the script.

      There are two scripts sources: `bundle.min.js` and `bundle.debug.min.js` You can
      switch between which bundle the browser loads to experiment with the application.

      - `bundle.min.js`: Is what the site would serve to their users. It has gone
        through rollup, build-optimizer, and uglify with tree shaking.
      - `bundle.debug.min.js`: Is what the developer would like to see when debugging
        the application. It has also gone through full pipeline of esbuild, babel optimization,
        plugins from the devkit and terser, however mangling is disabled and the minified
        file is formatted using prettier (to ease debugging).
