/**
 * Integrating a `Tsurge` migration requires the "merging" of all
 * compilation unit data into a single "global migration data".
 *
 * This is achieved in a Beam pipeline by having a pipeline stage that
 * takes all compilation unit worker data and writing it into a single
 * buffer, delimited by new lines (`\n`).
 *
 * This "merged bytes files", containing all unit data, one per line, can
 * then be parsed by this function and fed into the migration merge logic.
 *
 * @returns All compilation unit data for the migration.
