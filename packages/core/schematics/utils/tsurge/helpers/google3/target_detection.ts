 * By default, Tsurge will always create an Angular compiler program

 * third-party where Tsurge migrations run in Angular CLI projects.
 *
 * In first party, when running against full Google3, creating an Angular
 * program for e.g. plain `ts_library` targets is overly expensive and
 * can result in out of memory issues for large TS targets. In 1P we can
 * reliably distinguish between TS and Angular targets via the `angularCompilerOptions`.
