 * Information about how a type or `InjectionToken` interfaces with the DI
 * system. This describes:
 *
 * 1. *How* the type is provided
 *    The declaration must specify only one of the following:
 *    - A `value` which is a predefined instance of the type.
 *    - A `factory` which defines how to create the given type `T`, possibly
 *      requesting injection of other types if necessary.
 *    - Neither, in which case the type is expected to already be present in the
 *      injector hierarchy. This is used for internal use cases.
 *
 * 2. *Where* the type is stored (if it is stored)
 *    - The `providedIn` parameter specifies which injector the type belongs to.
 *    - The `token` is used as the key to store the type in the injector.
